<br>
<br>
<br><b>1 EXT. SPACE
<br></b>
<br>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
<br>
<br>A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.
<br>
<br>War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.
<br>
<br>In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.
<br>
<br>As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .
<br>
<br>PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.
<br>
<br><b>2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.
<br>
<br><b>3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .
<br>
<br><b>4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE
<br></b>
<br>The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.
<br>
<br><b>5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!
<br>
<br>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
<br>
<br>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.
<br>
<br><b>6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
<br>
<br>Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Come on, Master.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?
<br>
<br>ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .
<br>
<br><b>7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>ODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
<br>
<br>The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.
<br>
<br><b>8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.
<br>
<br>Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.
<br>
<br>ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Incoming!!
<br>
<br>ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!
<br>
<br>Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Here we go.
<br>
<br>The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
<br>
<br>In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.
<br>
<br>ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I know. I know!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I know. I know!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.
<br>
<br>Obi-Wan shakes his head.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS nervously.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
<br>
<br>ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
<br>A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
<br>Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.
<br>
<br>ODD BALL: There are too many of them.
<br>
<br>CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
<br>
<br>Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .
<br>
<br>The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: They're coming around!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!
<br>
<br>Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.
<br>
<br>Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
<br>
<br>The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .
<br>
<br>ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan�s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Move to the right.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
<br>
<br>ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
<br>
<br><b>9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
<br>OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.
<br>
<br>They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Next move?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.
<br>
<br>The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.
<br>
<br><b>10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.
<br>
<br><b>11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.
<br>
<br>BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
<br>
<br>As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Ready.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.
<br>
<br><b>12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
<br>
<br>They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!
<br>
<br>The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
<br>
<br>They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!
<br>
<br>They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.
<br>
<br>The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.
<br>
<br><b>13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Here's a way out.
<br>
<br>As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.
<br>
<br><b>14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.
<br>
<br><b>15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.
<br>
<br><b>16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.
<br>
<br><b>17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.
<br>
<br><b>18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE
<br></b>
<br>A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.
<br>
<br><b>19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.
<br>
<br><b>20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Destroyers!!
<br>
<br>Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.
<br>
<br>BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.
<br>
<br>The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.
<br>
<br><b>21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.
<br>
<br><b>22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: No, did you?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: No!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.
<br>
<br><b>23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.
<br>
<br><b>24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN: Artoo?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.
<br>
<br><b>25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.
<br>
<br><b>26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.
<br>
<br><b>27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The elevator starts to descend rapidly.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.
<br>
<br><b>28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.
<br>
<br>DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
<br>
<br>DROID 2: Roger, roger.
<br>
<br><b>29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
<br>
<br><b>30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!
<br>
<br>The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.
<br>
<br><b>31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!
<br>
<br>ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.
<br>
<br><b>32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .
<br>
<br><b>33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!
<br>
<br><b>34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.
<br>
<br>Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .
<br>
<br><b>35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.
<br>
<br><b>36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN: What was that all about?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He's trying!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!
<br>
<br><b>37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.
<br>
<br><b>38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
<br>At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
<br>As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Are you all right?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I was about to say that.
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
<br>
<br>DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.
<br>
<br>As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
<br>ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
<br>ANAKIN hits the archway.
<br>DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.
<br>
<br>COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don�t use them.
<br>
<br>Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
<br>Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.
<br>
<br><b>39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Do it!!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
<br>
<br>The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.
<br>

<br>ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
<br>
<br>Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
<br>

<br></b>
<br>As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
<br>Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.
<br>
<br><b>45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

<br>As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
<br>ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.
<br>
<br><b>46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.

<br>ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.

<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.
<br>
<br><b>53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.
<br>
<br>ANAKINN: Hold on.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: What is that?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!
<br>
<br>They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.
<br>
<br><b>54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
<br>
<br><b>55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.
<br>
<br><b>57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I agree.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: What are we going to do?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't know.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.
<br>
<br><b>58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.
<br>

<br>OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.

<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Ray shields!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
<br>
<br>The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .
<br>
<br>ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.
<br>
<br>Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
<br>ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.
<br>
<br>SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

<br>
<br>A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Artoo.
<br>
<br>ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
<br>OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.
<br>
<br>The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.
<br>
<br>CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
<br>OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
<br>ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
<br>OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
<br>ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
<br>
<br>PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.
<br>
<br>One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.
<br>
<br>PILOT: The ship is breaking up!
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
<br>OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.
<br>
<br><b>63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

<br>OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.

<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Well?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
<br>
<br>ARTOO beeps.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
<br>
<br>A large part of the ship breaks away.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We lost something.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What's our speed?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
<br>
<br>FlRESHIP PILOT: We'll take you in.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.
<br>
<br>The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.

<br></b>
<br>A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.

<br>The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
<br>The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
<br>
<br>BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
<br>
<br>ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
<br>
<br>ARTOO beeps.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
<br>
<br><b>70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
<br>
<br>Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Excuse me.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.
<br>
<br>PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
<br>
<br>PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.
<br>
<br>PADME: Wait, not here . . .
<br>
<br>He grabs her again.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
<br>
<br>PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
<br>
<br>PADME: I'm just excited to see you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
<br>
<br>PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!
<br>
<br>PADME begins to cry.
<br>
<br>PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?
<br>
<br>PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
<br>
<br>PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
<br>
<br>PADME: Something wonderful has happened.
<br>
<br>They look at each other for a long moment.
<br>
<br>PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.
<br>
<br>PADME: What are we going to do?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?

<br>PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
<br>
<br>PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!
<br>
<br>PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
<br>
<br>PADME: So love has blinded you?
<br>

He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.

<br>PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.
<br>

<br>
<br>YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.

<br>YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
<br>
<br>MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
<br>
<br>YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
<br>
<br>MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
<br>
<br>MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
<br>
<br>YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
<br>
<br>MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN is disappointed.

<br><b>84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: And?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What situation?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.

<br>YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
<br>
<br>YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
<br>
<br>MACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
<br>
<br>MACE:I wish I did.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
<br>
<br>MACE: So the prophecy says.
<br>
<br>YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.
<br>
<br>YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
<br>
<br>The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.

<br></b>
<br>Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.
<br>
<br>PADME: Thank you, Captain.
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.
<br>
<br>PADME: I'll be up in a while.
<br>
<br>MOTEE: Yes, my lady.
<br>
<br>C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
<br>
<br>PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
<br>
<br>The golden droid turns and exits.
<br>
<br>PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?
<br>
<br>PADME jumps and turns around.
<br>
<br>PADME: You startled me.
<br>
<br>He sits next to her on the bench.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: How are you feeling?
<br>
<br>PADME: He keeps kicking.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
<br>
<br>PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.
<br>
<br>She puts his hand on her belly.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
<br>
<br>They laugh.
<br>
<br>PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
<br>
<br>PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
<br>
<br>PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?
<br>
<br>PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
<br>
<br>PADME: What is it?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Nothing.
<br>
<br>PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.
<br>
<br>They look in each other's eyes.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
<br>
<br>PADME is startled at this.
<br>
<br>PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.
<br>
<br>PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.
<br>
<br>PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.

<br><b>88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
<br>ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
<br>ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far � but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: They try.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't think . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: . . . evil.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE smiles.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN is deep in thought.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: No.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What happened to him?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.

<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
<br>
<br>MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
<br>
<br>YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?
<br>
<br>All the JEDI concur.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
<br>
<br>They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.
<br>
<br>MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.
<br>
<br>YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.
<br>
<br>MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
<br>
<br>YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.
<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
<br>
<br>YODA: I agree.
<br>

<br>
<br>MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN is angry.

<br>OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.
<br>
<br>PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.

<br>OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.

<br><b>100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY
<br></b>
<br>The Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.
<br>
<br>They exit the landing platform.
<br>
<br><b>101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY
<br></b>
<br>They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.
<br>
<br>JAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
<br>
<br>The Gungan waves to Anakin.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.
<br>
<br>JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
<br>
<br>Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN becomes worried.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.
<br>
<br><b>102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM
<br></b>
<br>PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Save your energy.
<br>
<br>PADME: I can't!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .
<br>
<br><b>103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
<br>
<br>PADME: He came by this morning.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What did he want?
<br>
<br>PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.
<br>
<br>PADME: He's worried about you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?
<br>
<br>She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.
<br>
<br>PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: And he's not?
<br>
<br>PADME: You have been moody lately.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
<br>
<br>PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
<br>
<br>PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
<br>
<br>PADME: You expect too much of yourself.
<br>
<br>They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.
<br>
<br>PADME: Save me?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: From my nightmares.
<br>
<br>PADME: Is that what's bothering you?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.
<br>
<br>PADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
<br>
<br>PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.
<br>
<br>PADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
<br>
<br>They embrace and kiss.
<br>
<br><b>104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.
<br>
<br><b>105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
<br>
<br>A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan�s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I understand.
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.
<br>
<br>The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.
<br>
<br><b>106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY
<br></b>
<br>On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.
<br>
<br>BODYGUARD: What was his name?
<br>
<br>TlON MEDON: He didn't say.
<br>
<br>They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.
<br>
<br><b>107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.
<br>
<br><b>108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.
<br>
<br><b>109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
<br>He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
<br>OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I need transportation.
<br>
<br>WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Get it for me.
<br>
<br>WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.
<br>
<br>One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: This one.
<br>
<br>The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.
<br>
<br>WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.
<br>
<br><b>110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY
<br></b>
<br>The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.
<br>
<br><b>111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
<br>
<br>NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN is deep in thought.
<br>
<br><b>112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Hello, there!
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!
<br>
<br>About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
<br>They stare at each other for a moment.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.
<br>
<br>The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
<br>OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Your move.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
<br>
<br>His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I don't think so.
<br>
<br>TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.
<br>
<br><b>113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
<br>The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.
<br>

<br></b>
<br>PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
<br>
<br>PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
<br>
<br>PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
<br>
<br>FANGZAR: But surely . . .
<br>
<br>The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
<br>
<br>PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
<br>
<br>PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What do you mean?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.
<br>
<br><b>117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

<br>KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.
<br>
<br>CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
<br>have begun our attack.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
<br>intentions.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes, Master.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.
<br>
<br>MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
<br>office.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
<br>
<br>Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
<br>
<br>YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.

<br>
<br>PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I should be there with him.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
<br>
<br>They walk into the hallway.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
<br>
<br>They stop.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What did you say?
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're wrong!
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
<br>PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

<br>OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.
<br>

<br>OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.
<br>
<br><b>121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
<br>
<br>The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.
<br>
<br><b>122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.
<br>
<br><b>123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.
<br>
<br>GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.
<br>
<br>The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.

<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
<br>
<br>MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: How do you know this?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: Are you sure?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Absolutely.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I must go, Master.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Yes, Master.
<br>
<br>MACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.

<br>The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.

<br>MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
<br>
<br>MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
<br>
<br>MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
<br>
<br>MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!
<br>
<br>MACE: Not yet!
<br>
<br>PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: It's treason, then.
<br>
<br>A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.
<br>
<br>Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.
<br>
<br>In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.
<br>
<br>They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.
<br>
<br>MACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: No! No! You will die!
<br>
<br>PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: He's the traitor. Stop him!
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.

<br>MACE WlNDU: Don't listen to him, Anakin.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
<br>
<br>MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
<br>
<br>MACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .
<br>
<br>MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.
<br>

<br>Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.
<br>
<br>As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
<br>The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!
<br>
<br>His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What have I done?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN sits.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Good.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
<br>

<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
<br>

<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I understand, Master.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.

OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
<br>
<br>A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.
<br>
<br>BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.
<br>
<br>The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.
<br>

<br>THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!
<br>
<br>PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.
<br>
<br>PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
<br>
<br>PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
<br>
<br>C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: What is going on?
<br>
<br>ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
<br>
<br>PADME: I can't believe that!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
<br>
<br>C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.
<br>
<br>PADME: What about Obi-Wan?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
<br>
<br>PADME: How could this have happened?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
<br>
<br>PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.
<br>
<br>PADME: What are you saying?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
<br>
<br>PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.
<br>
<br>PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.
<br>
<br>They kiss.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.
<br>
<br>PADME: I will.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.
<br>
<br>ARTOO beeps.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.
<br>
<br>ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?
<br>
<br>PADME: No thank you, Threepio.
<br>

<br>YODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?
<br>
<br>YODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?
<br>
<br>YODA: Heard from no one, have we.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?
<br>
<br>YODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return.
<br>
<br>YODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.

<br>A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.
<br>
<br>PADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
<br>
<br>TYPHO bows.
<br>
<br>CAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
<br>
<br>PADME: I'll be all right, Captain.
<br>
<br>He goes to the speeder and gets in.
<br>
<br>PADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: Oh, dear.
<br>
<br>TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.
<br>
<br><b>192 INT. NABOO SKIFF
<br></b>
<br>THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.
<br>

<br></b>
<br>A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master.
<br>
<br><b>194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.
<br>
<br><b>195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
<br></b>
<br>The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .
<br>
<br>They embrace.
<br>
<br>PADME: Oh, Anakin!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
<br>
<br>PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What things?
<br>
<br>PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
<br>
<br>PADME: He cares about us.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Us??!
<br>
<br>PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
<br>
<br>PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
<br>
<br>PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
<br>
<br>PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
<br>
<br>PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
<br>
<br>PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
<br>can't follow.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?
<br>
<br>PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!
<br>
<br>PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.
<br>
<br>PADME: No!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
<br>
<br>PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
<br>
<br>ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Let her go!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You turned her against me.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You will not take her from me.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN throws off his cloak.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
<br>
<br>They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Your new Empire?
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
<br>
<br>(ignites his lightsaber)
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You will try.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
<br>They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
<br>ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.
<br>
<br><b>196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.
<br>
<br>YODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.
<br>
<br>YODA: Surprised?
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
<br>
<br>The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
<br>YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.
<br>
<br><b>197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.
<br>
<br><b>198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>R2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship's doorway.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
<br>
<br>C-3PO starts down the ramp.
<br>
<br><b>199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
<br>
<br>YODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
<br>
<br>YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.
<br>
<br>YODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.
<br>
<br>YODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??
<br>
<br>YODA ignites his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>DARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.
<br>
<br>YODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
<br>
<br>Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN�s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.
<br>
<br><b>201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor's Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.
<br>
<br><b>202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>The battle intensifies.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
<br>Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
<br>They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.
<br>They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.
<br>
<br><b>203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.
<br>
<br>The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.
<br>
<br>YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
<br>
<br>YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.
<br>
<br>YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.
<br>
<br>YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.
<br>
<br><b>204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.
<br>
<br>The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.
<br>ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.
<br>
<br><b>205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY
<br></b>
<br>ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.
<br>
<br><b>206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.
<br>
<br><b>207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT

<br>YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.
<br>
<br>YODA: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: (in speeder) There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
<br>
<br><b>208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

<br>A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.
<br>
<br>CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.
<br>
<br>MAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: Double your search.
<br>
<br>CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
<br>
<br>MAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
<br>
<br>PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.
<br>
<br><b>209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
<br>Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.
<br>
<br>It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.
<br>
<br><b>210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.
<br>

<br>YODA straightens himself out.
<br>
<br>YODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
<br>
<br>YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.
<br>
<br><b>212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
<br></b>
<br>OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.
<br>
<br><b>213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY
<br></b>
<br>C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.
<br>
<br>C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.
<br>
<br><b>214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
<br></b>
<br>From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.
<br>
<br>SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Don't try it.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN: I hate you!
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
<br>
<br>ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.
<br>
<br><b>215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

<br>OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.
<br>
<br>He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

<br>OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.

<br>PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.
<br>
<br>PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
<br>OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.

<br>
<br>YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
<br>
<br>QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
<br>
<br>YODA: Eternal consciousness.
<br>
<br>QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
<br>
<br>YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
<br>
<br>QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
<br>
<br>YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
<br>
<br>YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.

<br>POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: She's dying?
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.
<br>
<br>YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
<br>
<br>The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.
<br>
<br>C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.

<br>ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.

<br></b>
<br>The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme.
<br>
<br>PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: It's a boy.
<br>
<br>PADME: Luke . . .
<br>
<br>PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.
<br>
<br>PADME: . . . Leia.
<br>
<br>R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.

<br>VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.
<br>
<br><b>230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT
<br></b>
<br>OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
<br>
<br>PADME: I can't . . .
<br>
<br>PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Save your energy.
<br>
<br>PADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
<br>
<br>A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.
<br>

<br>DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.
<br>
<br>MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.
<br>
<br>The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER looks around the room.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.
<br>
<br>DARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.
<br>
<br>A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.
<br>
<br>DARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!
<br>
<br>VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

<br>
<br>YODA: Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
<br>
<br>YODA: Split up, they should be.
<br>
<br>BAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: And what of the boy?
<br>
<br>YODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
<br>
<br>YODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
<br>
<br>BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.
<br>
<br>YODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Training??
<br>
<br>YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Who?
<br>
<br>YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
<br>
<br>YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
<br>
<br>OBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?
<br>
<br>YODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.

</b>


           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

<b>          CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

<b>                         ARE IN:
</b>
<b>          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT
</b>
          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

<b>                         QUIET:
</b>
<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

<b>          ROLLS OFF FAST --
</b>
<b>          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

<b>                          POE
</b>          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           We've got company.

<b>          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT
</b>
          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

<b>          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.
</b>
<b>                          POE
</b>           You have to hide.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

<b>          IN THE DISTANCE.
</b>          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

<b>                          POE (CONT'D)
</b>           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

<b>          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

<b>                          POE
</b>           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

<b>          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

<b>          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --
</b>
<b>          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
</b>          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

<b>                         HIM:
</b>
<b>                          SENIOR TROOPER
</b>           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Look how old you've become.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)

<b>          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

<b>                          KYLO REN

<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA
</b>           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:

<b>          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
</b>          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.

          The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
          brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
          Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

          Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
          Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

<b>          CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

</b>           On my command!
          The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

<b>           CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
</b>           Fire!
          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his

          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
          knows he's in trouble.

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER
</b>
          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

<b>          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

<b>          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY
</b>
          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

<b>          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
</b>          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY
</b>
          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

<b>          SPACESHIPS.
</b>
<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)

<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
          her speeder toward the town.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

<b>          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b>
          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

<b>                          UNKAR
</b>           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

<b>          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY
</b>
          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

<b>          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK
</b>
          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>          CONTINUED: just 'cause.
          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           NOMA.
</b>          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           That's just Teedo. Wants you for
           parts. He has no respect for anyone.
           Your antenna's bent.

           the first time,

           (stands, heads off)

                         
          BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.

           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

          conversation at all.
          She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
          Finally, she hears herself say:

          Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
          watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

<b>          INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
           Capture the droid if we can, but
           destroy it if we must.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           How capable are your soldiers,
           General?

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>
<b>                          (WITH VITRIOL)

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           They're obviously skilled at
           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Then they should have no problem
           retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           Careful, Ren. That your "personal
           interests" not interfere with orders
           from Leader Snoke.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I want that map. For your sake, I
           suggest you get it.
          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY
</b>
          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

<b>          BEEPING BB-8.
</b>          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

<b>                          REY
</b>           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

<b>                          REY
</b>           What's your hurry, thief?

<b>                          FINN
</b>           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

<b>          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!
</b>
<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)

           stole it!

<b>                          FINN
</b>           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

<b>                          AGAIN)
</b>
<b>           STOP IT!
</b>
<b>                          REY
</b>           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

<b>                          (RELIVING IT)
</b>           Poe didn't make it.
           (sees BB-8 is sad,

<b>                          ROLLS OFF)
</b>           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

<b>                          REY
</b>           So you're with the Resistance?

</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:
</b>          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

<b>                          (WHISPERS)
</b>           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

<b>                          REY
</b>           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

<b>                          REY
</b>           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

<b>                          REY
</b>           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)
</b>           (re: her hand)
           What are you doing?!

<b>                          FINN
</b>           Come on!
          Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
          SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

<b>          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
          a maze of tents:

           I know how to run without you holding
           my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

<b>                          STORMTROOPER
</b>           Call in the air strike!
          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

<b>          INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY
</b>
          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
          Quiet, urgent:

<b>                          REY
</b>           They're shooting at both of us!

</b>           I'm not the one who chased you down

<b>                          (TO BB-8)
</b>           Are you okay?
          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

<b>                          REY (CONT'D)

          Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
          As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

<b>          FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

          WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
          EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

<b>                          REY
</b>           Hey!
          As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

<b>                          FINN
</b>           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her
          life been asked it.

<b>                          REY
</b>           Yeah.

          Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
          and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO

          They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT

          quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

          She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
          run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up

          Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --

          They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he

          Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
          off one way, Han in another.
          The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
          up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.
          They're SCARED.

           two fugitives.
          Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
          BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
          Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           First I've heard of it.
          Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
          Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

<b>                          RAZOO QIN-FEE
</b>           Search the freighter.
          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
          AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
          FAST in the opposite direction they came.
          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
          a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

<b>                          REY

           the blast doors in that corridor, we

          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
          they do. Finn quickly joins in.
          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
          GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

</b>          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
          The GANGS look around.
          Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

</b>           ... I got a bad feeling about this...
          Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,

          help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
          distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
          Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
          they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE

          that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
          Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
          very much in control, of power:

          someone addressing them.
          We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

</b>           The weapon. It is ready. I believe
           the time has come to use it. We
           shall destroy the government that
           supports the Resistance, the Republic.
           Without their friends to protect
           them, the Resistance will be
           vulnerable, and we will stop them
           before they reach Skywalker.
          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

</b>           Go. Oversee preparations.

<b>                          GENERAL HUX

          General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
          go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

<b>                          SNOKE

           felt it?

</b>           Yes.

<b>                          SNOKE
</b>           There's something more. The droid
           we seek is aboard the Millennium
           Falcon. In the hands of your father,
           Han Solo.
          Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

<b>                          KYLO REN

<b>                          HAN

<b>                          REY
</b>           What fight?

<b>                          MAZ
</b>           The only fight: against the dark
           side. Through the ages, I've seen
           evil take many forms. The Sith.
           The Empire. Today, it is the First
           Order. Their shadow is spreading
           across the galaxy. We must face
           them. Fight them. All of us.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           There is no fight against the First
           Order! Not one we can win. Look
           around. There's no chance we haven't
           been recognized already. I bet you
           the First Order is on their way right--
          Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
          him -- her eyes get HUGE.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           What's this? What are you doing?
          Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
          BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
          Finn.

<b>                          FINN (CONT'D)
</b>           Solo, what is she doing?

<b>                          HAN
</b>           I don't know, but it ain't good.

<b>                          MAZ
</b>           If you live long enough you see the
           same eyes in different people. I'm
           looking at the eyes of a man who
           wants to run.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           (eyes on Maz)
           You don't know a thing about me.

           need to run.
          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
          chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

<b>                          MAZ

           work for transportation to the Outer

          Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Keep it, kid.
          Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
          back to normal, and turns to Han.

          Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

<b>          DOOR OPENS.
</b>          Hesitant, Rey enters.

<b>          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

<b>                          YOUNG GIRL
</b>
<b>           NO!
</b>          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

<b>                          YOUNG GIRL
</b>           No, come back!

</b>           Quiet, girl!
          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

<b>          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

<b>                          REY
</b>           What was that? I shouldn't have
           gone in there.

<b>                          MAZ
</b>           That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
           father's before him and now, it calls
           to you!
          Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

<b>                          REY
</b>           I have to get back to Jakku.

<b>                          MAZ

           (reaches out, hold

<b>                          REY'S HAND)
</b>           Dear child. I see your eyes. You
           already know the truth. Whomever
           you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
           never coming back. But... there's
           someone who still could.

<b>                          REY
</b>           Luke.

<b>                          MAZ
</b>           The belonging you seek is not behind
           you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,

           thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

</b>           I'm never touching that again. I

          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

          Heads toward the woods.

<b>          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY
</b>
          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces

           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of

          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

<b>          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

<b>          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO

          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY

          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

</b>           Kept it locked away.

<b>                          HAN

          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

<b>                          STORMTROOPER

          She panics, then realizes:

</b>           Safety!
          SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
          and retreats, calls to BB-8:
          BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
          chasing Troopers!

           through her fear)
           I hope so, too.
          BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
          a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and

          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

          command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
          arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance

           And I need to talk to him. That was
           incredibly brave, what you did.
           Renouncing the First Order, saving
           this man's life --

           Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
          Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

<b>                          POE
</b>           Finn's familiar with the weapon that
           destroyed the Hosnian system. He
           worked on the base.

          C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           General, I regret to inform you, but
           this map recovered from BB-8 is only
           partially complete. And even worse,
           it matches no charted system on
           record. We simply do not have enough
           information to locate Master Luke.

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           I can't believe I was so foolish to
           think that I could just find Luke

          LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
          dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
          the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
          RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
          R2. Nothing. Then:

<b>           C-3PO (O.S.)
</b>           BB-8. You're wasting your time.

<b>           C-3PO (CONT'D)
</b>           It is very doubtful that R2 would
           have the rest of the map in his backup

<b>                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
</b>           I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in

</b>           Listen to me, will you? I know every
           time you... every time you look at
           me, you're reminded of him.

</b>           There was nothing we could've done.
           (hard for him to say)
           There was too much Vader in him.

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           That's why I wanted him to train

           You'll be relieved to hear that I
           have no idea.

</b>          Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
</b>           You still want to kill me.

<b>                          REY
</b>           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Tell me about the droid.

<b>                          REY
</b>           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
</b>           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
</b>           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
           leave...
           (then, slight smile)
           At night, desperate to sleep... you
           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
           the island...
          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

<b>           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
</b>           And Han Solo. You feel like he's

           disappointed you.

<b>                          REY

          But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I know you've seen the map. It's in
           there... and now you'll give it to
           me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
           too.
          Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

<b>                          REY

<b>          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
</b>          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

<b>          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on

          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

          He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE
          ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead.
          Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a

<b>          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY
</b>
          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
          Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
          infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

<b>          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
          into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED

          she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

          Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
          and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS
</b>
          A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
          CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
          Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS
</b>
          A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
          CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
          SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Find them.
          They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

</b>
          The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
          carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
          They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
          CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
          shadows of the grillwork.

<b>          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS
</b>
          The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
          and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

<b>          GONE.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
          Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
          he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
          demeanor changes --
          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

<b>          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
</b>          Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
          catwalk. He turns.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Han Solo. I've been waiting for
           this day for a long time.
          Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
          that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
          a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
          and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
          the catwalk below.

</b>           What do you think you'll see if I
           do?
          Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           The face of my son.
          Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
          of his son for the first time as a man.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           Your son is gone. He was weak and
           foolish, like his father. So I
           destroyed him.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           That's what Snoke wants you to believe
           but it's not true. My son is alive.
          SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS
</b>
          Kylo flares.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           It's too late.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

<b>          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS
</b>
          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

<b>                          HAN
</b>           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

<b>          VANISHES.
</b>          Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
          but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

<b>          DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS
</b>
<b>          OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

          Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
          KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
          life slipping away.
          Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

          Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
          horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
          CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO

          then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
          ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
          the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
          rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

<b>                          FINN
</b>           The Falcon's this way.
          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
          forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
          out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
          they can't run.

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes

          A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

<b>          STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.

          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's

          Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF

          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
          LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --

          the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.

          Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
          BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
          as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
          She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
          dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
          MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
          Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
          DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

<b>          MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!
</b>
<b>                          KYLO REN
</b>           You need a teacher! I can show you
           the ways of the Force!

<b>                          REY
</b>           The Force.
          Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
          she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
          SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
          FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
          BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
          Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
          GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

<b>          AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND
</b>
<b>          CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
</b>          SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
          And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
          But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
          even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
          SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

<b>          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
          giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
          watches this out the control room window in horror. He
          hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

<b>                          COLONEL DATOO
</b>           Lieutenant, get back to your station!

<b>                          YOUNG TECHNICIAN
</b>           (stops, fleetingly)
           Just look. We won't survive -- even
           Hux has gone!
          As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

<b>           GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
</b>           Supreme Leader.

<b>          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
          distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
          but is horrified, heartsick:

<b>                          GENERAL HUX
</b>           The fuel cells have ruptured. The
           collapse of the planet has begun.
          Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

<b>                          SNOKE
</b>           Leave the base at once and come to
           me with Kylo Ren.

<b>                          (GRIM)
</b>           It is time to complete his training.

<b>          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
          Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
          FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
          FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
          sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

<b>                          REY
</b>           Finn! Finn...
          Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
          body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
          holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
          They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
          planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
          is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

<b>          LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
</b>          KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

<b>          ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
</b>          CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

<b>          EXT. FALCON - NIGHT
</b>
          Chewie exits the ship.
          MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
          with them back into the ship --

<b>          INT. FALCON - NIGHT
</b>
          Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
</b>
          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

<b>          INT. X-WING - NIGHT
</b>

<b>                          POE
</b>           All teams! I got eyes on them!

<b>                          SNAP
</b>           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

<b>                          POE
</b>           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

<b>          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

<b>                          MEDIC
</b>           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

<b>                          (MORE)
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>                         CONTINUED:

<b>           C-3PO (CONT'D)
</b>           (he swats R2-D2, who

<b>                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
</b>           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY
</b>
          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

<b>           C-3PO (O.S.)
</b>           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

<b>           C-3PO (CONT'D)
</b>           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

<b>          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
</b>          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

<b>                          POE
</b>           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

<b>          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN
</b>
<b>          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
</b>          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           Oh! The map! It is complete!

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

<b>                          C-3PO
</b>           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

<b>          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY
</b>
          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

<b>                          REY
</b>           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

<b>                          LEIA
</b>           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

<b>                          LEIA (CONT'D)
</b>           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

<b>          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
</b>
          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

<b>          EXT. D'QAR - DAY
</b>
          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

<b>          EXT. SPACE - DAY
</b>
          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
</b>
          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
</b>
          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY
</b>
          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

<b>          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY
</b>
          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

<b>          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
</b>
          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

<b>          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
</b>          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

<br>     VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit.
<br>     Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say
<br>     "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not
<br>     domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be

<br>     ...a beat of regret...
<br>
<br>     ...and Vincent's gun came up so fast, Max didn't even see it.
<br>     THREE SMALL POPS. A different gun: .22 caliber Ruger with a
<br>     thick, silent barrel. Three small holes. And Daniel's head
<br>     falls forward. Vincent catches it, arranges Daniel's arms so
<br>     that Daniel's head rests on them as if he's taking a nap. And
<br>     Vincent did it gently, almost regretfully. A red mist of blood
<br>     swirls in the air.

<br>                he had to hire some help to look out
<br>                for the bad children. So he hired
<br>                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a
<br>                list with all the names of all the bad
<br>                children, and Pedro would come every
<br>                night to check them out. And the
<br>                people, the little kids that were
<br>                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *
<br>                their prayers, Pedro would leave a
<br>                little wooden donkey on their windows.
<br>                And he would come back and if the
<br>                children were still misbehaving, he
<br>                would take them away and nobody would
<br>                ever see them again. Now, if I am
<br>                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do
<br>                you think jolly old Santa Claus would
<br>                feel if one day Pedro came into his
<br>                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?

<br>       keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the
<br>       door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper:
<br>
<br><b>                            ANNIE

<br>       A frozen moment. Eyes locked. Knowing they're probably going
<br>       to die together, even though they hardly know each other.
<br>
<br><b>       THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER

<br>
<br>       Max rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here
<br>       comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees
<br>       Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...

<br>       gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, "go ahead, kill
<br>       me..." through the shattered window.
<br>
<br>       Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.
<br>       Watching Max. A little smile on his face.

<br>       Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the
<br>       floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the
<br>       weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot
<br>       Peter Yip the first time.
<br>
<br>       Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His
<br>       brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in
<br>       fact.
<br>
<br>       The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among
<br>       the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter
<br>       quietly.
<br>
<br>       Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like
<br>       way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if
<br>       confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back
<br>       of the car.
<br>
<br>       The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.
<br>
<br>       Max watches Vincent walk away.
<br>
<br>       Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an
<br>       aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his
<br>       breath.
<br>
<br>       Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.
<br>       Slides the second door open. Enters.
<br>
<br>       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously
<br>       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the
<br>       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.
<br>
<br>       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across

<br>       Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if

<br>       soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.
<br>
<br>       Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks.
<br>
<br>       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all
<br>       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:

<br>       doing anything. Ever.
<br>
<br>       Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his
<br>       zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a
<br>       small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She
<br>       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the

<b>   
</b><b>   "CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"
</b><b>   
</b>   Play over this image.
<b>   
</b>   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SIDNEY
</b>                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
<b>   
</b>   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
</b>             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
             spray gun outta South Miami.
<b>   
</b>   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
             for two hundred and sell 'em for
             eight.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
<b>   ROBBIE.
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
<b>   
</b>   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
<b>   
</b>   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
<b>   
</b>   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
<b>   
</b>   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
<b>   
</b>   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Check out this body-builder chick...
             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell punches up the volume.
<b>   
</b>   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)

<b>   
</b>   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
   "Movieline Inside" magazine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b>   Louis keeps staring at he screen.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
   the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
   says:
<b>

<b>   
</b>   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,

<b>   
</b>   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;

   Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
   building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
<b>   
</b>   An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
   can be heard.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang

<b>   
</b>   The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a

   motions for Ordell to take a seat.

</b>   Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
<b>   
</b>   He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.
<b>   
</b>   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
   rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.

<b>   
</b>   Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
   bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.

             from Kentucky, and I think they're
             prejudiced against black men from the

                   (to Max)
             We almost done, ain't we?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b>             You go wait in the car. Wait a
             minute.
<b>

   keys on it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b>   Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
   comes back on the line.
<b>   
</b>   Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.
<b>

             This one's for the ignition...
                   (holding a little black
                   box)
             ... but you gotta hit this thing to
             shut the alarm off and unlock the
             door.

</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You ain't got to do nothing. Just
             point at it and push the button.
             You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
             means the alarm's off and the doors
             are open.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Okay.

<b>   
</b>   Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front

             hit by a bus or something and dies.

</b><b>                                               TIME CUT:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
</b><b>   
</b>   Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
   Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             What's the problem?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.
             That's why I need you, backup.

<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT
</b>             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You think I wanted to spend ten

</b>   Beaumont starts to speak -

</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Answer the question, nigga. Do you
             think I wanted to spend the thousand

<b>   
</b><b>                       BEAUMONT

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             But the only way to help you was to
             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
             how 'bout this? After we're through
             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
             My treat.

</b>   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.

</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)

</b><b>   TRUNK
</b><b>   
</b>   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
<b>   
</b>   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
<b>   
</b>   Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
<b>   
</b>   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
<b>   
</b>   ... then stops.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
<b>   
</b>   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
<b>   
</b>   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
<b>   
</b>   The cab goes black.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Don't worry. It's just me.
<b>   
</b>   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
<b>   
</b>   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell drives the Olds away.

             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're

             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun

</b>   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell closes the trunk.

                   (taking out a Viceroy and

</b>             Can I be of some assistance?
<b>   
</b>   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her

             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.

</b>             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like
             them, or a couple good-hearted guys
             like Mark and myself.

</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             Hey, this is my office. There's no
             smoking.

</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             We could, smart ass... or we could
             work out what's known as a
             Substantial Assistance Agreement.
             That is if you're willing to
             cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
             money and who you're giving it to.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.)
</b>             You got a good lawyer?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             Can she afford a good one is the
             question. Otherwise she'll be in
             Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
             the Public Defender gets around to
             her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.)
</b>             Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
             Livingston?
<b>   
</b>   Not a word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
             'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in
             the chest.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
<b>   
</b>   Not a word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS (O.S.)
</b>             If you don't want to talk to us, I
             guess we'll just have to hand you
             over to Customs.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie puts out her cigarette.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Okay, let's go.
<b>   
</b>   She stares down the cops.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DARGUS AND NICOLET
</b><b>   
</b>   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not a loser.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet joins back in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Help yourself.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
<b>   
</b>   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             My pocketbook.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             What's in it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Beauty products.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I'll count the money.
<b>   
</b>   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             What's this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's my diet shit.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Let's see what else is in there.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Oh, Miss Brown?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             And what would this be, Sweet and
             Low?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What the fuck is that shit?
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             I know what it looks like.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You planted that shit on me.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Look, that shit ain't mine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>                   (to Dargus)
             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
<b>   
</b><b>                       DARGUS
</b>             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
             about that fuckin' shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
             have a seat and tell us who might
             know something about this fuckin'

             of flight. If you don't post it or

</b>             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
             defendant's prior conviction and the
             extreme possibility of flight due to
             her occupation, the State requests a
             bond of no less than twenty-five

</b>             I'll set bond at ten thousand and set

</b>             The door was opened, so I just came
             right in.
<b>

</b>             I got some more business for ya.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Oh, yeah? What did he do?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (O.S.)
</b>             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             The bond for possession is only a
             thousand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
             it Possession with Intent. A black
             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit
             happened to a movie star. It's
             Possession.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It still sounds high.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
             all.

</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Before we start talking about
             stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
             the way first.

<b>

             bond on my boy, they start thinking
             with that where-there's-smoke-there's
             fire logic. They roust my ass outta
             bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
             Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
             to death. She thought they were gonna
             take my ass away for sure.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

             She's my friend. When my friends get

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Beaumont worked for you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             That's what the police thought. I
             told them I'm unemployed, how could I
             have anybody work for me? Now I bail
             out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
             police on me again, huh? Wanting to
             know was she doing things for me, was
             she bringing me that money!
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Was she?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
             client relationship? The lawyer can't
             tell nothing he hears?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You're not my client until you get
             busted and I bond you out.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             If there's no - what do you call it -
             confidentiality between us? Why would
             I tell you anything?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             - Jackie aint got time for all that
             shit -
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             - I'm telling you what I have to do.
             What you have to do, in case you
             forgot, is come up with premium of a
             thousand bucks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If I don't see it in front of me,
             you're right. It ain't shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
             don't have a tab.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Falsely accused? She didn't come back
             from Mexico with cocaine on her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Okay, man. I got your money. But
             don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'

<b>   
</b><b>                       ANITA

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             'Cause I look like I just got outta

   inn.

</b><b>   
</b>   CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
   the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
   join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
   return.
<b>   
</b>   The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
   dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
   Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
   lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
<b>   
</b>   The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
   and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
   years before it became a black bar.
<b>   
</b>   A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
   a bar candle in a red glass thing.
<b>   
</b>   Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
   white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
   Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No thanks, I quit three years ago.

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
             on.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's why I don't quit. If I can't
             fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
             They're hard to find here. I was
             locked up with the last two getting
             legal advice from a woman who was in
             for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
             with a baseball bat.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             She was more helpful than the fuckin'
             Public Defender.
                   (she takes a sip of wine)
             I don't know - I guess what I need is
             a lawyer, find out what my options
             are.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know, I figured out the other day
             I've written something like' fifteen
             thousand bonds since I've been in the
             business. I'd say about eighty
             percent of them were at least drug
             related. If you want, I can help you
             look at your options.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

</b>   A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.

</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             What have they told you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             So far I've been told I can cooperate
             and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
             stand mute and get as much as five
             years. Does that sound right?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'd say if you're tried and found
             guilty you won't get more than a year
             and a day. That's State time. Prison.

             Shit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             But they won't want to take you to
             trial. They'll offer you simple
             Possession, a few months of County
             time, and a year or two probation.
                   (pointing to her drink)
             How 'bout another?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
   ROWEN for two more.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know who put the dope in your
             bag?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, but that's not what this was
             about. They were fuckin waitin' for
             my ass. They knew I had that money,
             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             They wanted you to tell them what you

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I had 'em too. I burnt those two
             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What did they want to know?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Who gave me the money and who I was
             giving it to. And some guy they found
             in a trunk with his head blown off.
             Said it was him who told them 'bout
             me.
<b>   
</b>   The Waitress comes with the drinks.

</b>   Rowen exits.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             That would be Beaumont Livingston.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

             dead on Tuesday.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Ordell pick up his bond?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Same as you. Ten thousand.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The federal agent kinda half hinted
             Ordell might of done Beaumont.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
             but you didn't mention the Federal.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I didn't?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

             and Firearms.
<b>   
</b>   Max puts it together.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He's the one who wants you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It was the other guy who busted me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
             hell bonding out of federal court. He
             doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
             you to tell him what you know. He
             uses you to get a line on Ordell,
             make a case, then take him federal.
             You know what Ordell's into?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             How many trips did you make?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             With ten thousand? Nine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He's got that kinda money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Cash poor?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie gets exasperated.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Ask A.T.F. They might give you
             permission.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, if I cooperate.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
             gonna have to give 'em something.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
             name - I don't really know shit about
             what he does or how he does it - That
             don't give me much to bargain with.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
             Show a willingness to be helpful. You
             want to stay out of jail, don't you?
<b>   
</b>   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL'S POV
</b><b>   
</b>   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
   off.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL
</b><b>   
</b>   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
<b>   
</b>   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
   moment, then Jackie opens the door.
<b>

</b>   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
   the living room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You got some booze?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
   frightened.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
   doesn't turn on the light.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You gonna thank me?

</b>   Taking a glass from the cupboard.

</b>   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.

   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.

             to, too.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They asked.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And what was your answer?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie says to his face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're not asking the right
             questions.
<b>   
</b>   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Beaumont Livingston.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I knew it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I didn't tell 'em anything.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             My name come up?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b>   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             You say anything about me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They told me.
<b>   
</b>   At this moment the film becomes a:
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SPLIT SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX IN CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
<b>   
</b>   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   ORDELL AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You scared of me?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
<b>   
</b>   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hears a CLICK.
<b>   
</b>   Can't believe it.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX IN CAR
</b><b>   
</b>   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   THE GLOVE BOX
</b><b>   
</b>   The gun is gone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Where is it?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Is that what I think it is?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What do you think it is?
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I think it's a gun pressing against
             my dick.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You thought right... Now take your
             hands from around my throat, nigga.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
<b>   
</b><b>   END OF SPLIT SCREEN
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
   pushes him against the wall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             What the hell you doin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
<b>   
</b>   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Baby, I ain't come here -
<b>   
</b>   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Go sit over in that chair.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell sits.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Put both hands behind our head.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell does...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             This shits gettin silly now...
<b>   
</b>   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   A coffee table lays between them.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I just came here to talk.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
<b>   
</b>   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             - Baby, I didn't -
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell, very interested.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got a problem...
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All your money's in Mexico.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               TIME CUT:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   DOORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (O.S.)
</b>             Talk to you tomorrow.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell leaves.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE TO BLACK
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   OVER BLACK
</b><b>   
</b>   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
<b>   
</b><b>                                               FADE UP ON:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   SAME SHOT DORWAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
<b>   
</b>   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
<b>   
</b>   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
<b>   
</b>   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
<b>   
</b>   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If you're having some.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I am. Have a seat.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You get a chance to use it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Black's fine.
<b>   
</b>   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
<b>   
</b>   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Thanks, but I have my own now.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
<b>   
</b>   She turns off the water.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What, I couldn't hear you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
<b>   
</b>   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Let's just say I got one, okay?
<b>   
</b>   She turns on the coffeemaker.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Somebody loan it to you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
<b>   
</b>   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Want to hear some music?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sure.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It looks nice.
<b>   
</b>   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
<b>   
</b>   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't buy new stuff that often.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
<b>   
</b>   Max listens to the soul song.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             This is pretty.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Who is this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The Delfonics.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's nice.
<b>   
</b>   They listen for a moment.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
<b>

</b>             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>

</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He called you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We talked.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
<b>   
</b>   She pours the coffee.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             How do you get it out?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You're gonna offer to set him up?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
             'em.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's very possible Ordell's killed
             somebody.

</b>             I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
             doin' that probation thing again.

</b>             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about
             it.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

</b>             You know, I can't really feel too
             sorry for you in that department.

</b>   Jackie smiles.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             In fact, I'd make a bet that except
             possibly for an Afro - you look
             exactly the same as you did at twenty
             nine.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie smiles into her coffee.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             My ass ain't the same.

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I just feel like I'm always starting
             over. You said how many bonds you
             wrote?

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.

</b>   Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
   hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up

                   (he moves towards the
                   phone - to Melanie)
             Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
<b>   
</b>   He picks it up.
<b>

             Hey, Jackie...
                   (throwing a hard look at
                   Melanie)
<b>   
</b>   No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I was gonna tell you...
<b>   
</b>   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
<b>   
</b>   Louis smiles to himself.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's on the phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             No, not on the phone, let's meet
             somewhere. But you gotta make sure
             they ain't followin' you...
<b>   
</b>   Louis has the bong in front of him.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Yeah, there's another hit left.
<b>   
</b>   Louis takes it.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell's on the phone.

</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. COCKATOO INN
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
   both sides.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The Cockatoo Inn.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
             Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
             brick...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Oh, wait, you mean that place that
             has the big sign with a rooster on
             it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's a cockatoo.
<b>   
</b>   Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You okay?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
             smoke or laugh now it seems without
             coughing.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell hangs up the phone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>                   (to Louis)
             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
<b>   
</b>   Louis with a smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Way ahead of you.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
<b>   
</b>   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             Hope you don't mind keeping him
             company.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             No problem.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
             they're new.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
</b>             I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
             hang with Mel.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
   around and looks at Louis.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Want a Metrix?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             What's a Metrix?
<b>   
</b>   She crosses to the kitchen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             It's like this major meal in a shake
             you drink instead of having a big
             meal.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             It's a diet thing?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No thanks.
<b>   
</b>   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
<b>   
</b>   He looks around and spots something interesting.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
</b><b>   
</b>   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
<b>   
</b>   Louis picks up the photo frame.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             How old were you here?
<b>   
</b>   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Which one?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             The roller disco one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Fourteen.
<b>   
</b>   Louis walks over.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You're fourteen years old here?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I thought you were sixteen.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I was pretty much the same height now
             as I was then.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Were you a disco girl?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             So where did you go?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.
<b>   
</b>   She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
   till she hits Stop!
<b>   
</b>   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             That was taken at a place called
             "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b><b>                       LOUIS

</b>   Melanie drinks her Metrix.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I don't like dancing.

</b><b>                       MELANIE

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.
                   (he points to the cut
                   picture)
             Who didn't make the cut?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's a picture of me in Japan.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You been to Japan?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I lived there for about nine months.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             You lived in Japan, when?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             About five years ago.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Who's arm is that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Must of made quite an impression.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MEALINE
</b>             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That sounds like a problem.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie looks up at Louis.

</b>   Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
   middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
<b>

</b>             I told them you got a half a million
             dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
             bring it here.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell freaks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             You told them that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             It's true, isn't it?
<b>

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They know I'm delivering for you. I
             mention the half-million - they don't
             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

</b>   CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.
<b>   
</b>   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
<b>   
</b>   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANI
</b>             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
<b>   
</b>   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             He seems to be making out.
<b>   
</b>   Referring to the bong.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Is it dead?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah.
<b>   
</b>   She starts preparing a bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
<b>   
</b>   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
   while holding in the smoke, says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             That's not what I'm saying at all.
             (pause) You know where he went?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             No.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             He went to meet that stewardess.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Does that bother you?
<b>   
</b>   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

             tell you about that half-million

</b>             Course he did, he tells everybody

             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS

<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE

</b>   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKI
</b>             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             That's a good idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Who?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I don't know. One of your friends.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             A woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you want.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, I think a woman.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             But you don't?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I give it to someone else first.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's the idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             So we need two people, two women.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Can you cover that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Managers get ten percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I'll give ya ten.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Plus the same deal as before.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             I can do that.

</b>   It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
   dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
<b>   
</b>   She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by

</b>   The international food court, where fast-food versions of

</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Does it happen to all men?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And Annette's it for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
<b>   
</b>   With a smile on her face;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Who was your girl before Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I'm old enough to be her father.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             How old's Annette?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I don't care.
<b>   
</b>   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What're you, a bag lady?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I go back to work tomorrow.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You talk them into it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             They seem to like the idea.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Bring the money in and they follow
             it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You don't actually do it that way?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right around here, in the food court.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Sit down, leave the bag under the
             table?
<b>   
</b>   Jackie nods her head "yes."
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>             Will Ordell go for that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He was here?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I called you last night.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You think he's got a thing for you?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I see.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has he hinted around?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             You know some interesting people.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
<b>   
</b>   She shakes her head "no."
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             He tries to act cool.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What about you Max?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You're avoiding the question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Why?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             When did you decide?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.
<b>   
</b><b>   FLASH ON:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   A RELEASE FORM
</b><b>   
</b>   With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
   WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
   her, handing her his business card.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
             bondsman.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             The day you got me out of jail?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
             guy. I hear he's staying at this
             house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
             come home.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's
             house?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Uh-huh.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   FLASH ON
</b><b>   
</b>   Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
   goodbye.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             I dropped you off...
<b>   
</b>   Max finding no gun in his glove box.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             Went to my office, found out you took
             my gun...
<b>   
</b>   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (V.O.)
</b>             Got another gun and a stun gun...
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
</b><b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             And went to this guy's house in El
             Monte, and I waited for him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             What do you do when he comes home?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Shoot him with the stun gun. While
             he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
             'em to County.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             You do that?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             That's my job.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Did you do it that night?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             And is that it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             More or less.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Which one?
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             If you had a chance, unemployed now,
             to walk off with a half-million
             dollars, would you take it?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Don't even think about it. You could

<b>   
</b>   Hold for a few beats, then...

</b><b>   INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
   LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
   her.
<b>   
</b>   Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       NICOLET
</b>             We gotta stop meeting this way.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
   Honda.

</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
   She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
   passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
   flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
   envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
   very different from the first time they met. The three
   now almost act like friends.

   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They

   her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
   to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The

   her the ashtray Jackie was using.

</b>             I don't want no more fuckin'
             surprises. We do this the way I laid
             it out, or we don't do it at all.
<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
             figured you'd try an' pull some shit
             like this.
<b>

</b>             Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'

             whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.

<b>   
</b><b>                       ORDELL
</b>             Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
             ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
             was my friend, Simone. She's the one
             gonna be receiving the money, so I
             just wanted her to see how it works.
             She'll be here any minute. Nice
             woman, you'll like her.
<b>

</b>             It washes off. I tell them we're
             doing it the same way as before.
             They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the

</b>             Right, the one Simone gives me.
             Simone and I'll make the switch at

</b>             I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
             me. We can't risk switching bags out
             in the open or even in the dining
             area. That's why it has to be a
             woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
             fitting room.
<b>

</b>             So you come out with her
             Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
             Simone peeks out, waits for my man
             Louis here to give her a signal
             nobody's watchin'. She leaves the

</b>   The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa

   "Sally Leroy's."
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
</b><b>

   monster waves all over the place.
<b>   
</b>   The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   BEGINNING OF SHOT
</b><b>   
</b>   The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
   into the place and going up to the bar...
<b>   
</b>   A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
   workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b>   ... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
   MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
   older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
   like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
   As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
   head of hair comes into the f.g....
<b>   
</b>   The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
   on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
   Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.

</b>   Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The

             "You may leave us now." It's all part

             he saw me. The next trip you're gonna

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Right. Everything's the same, except

<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>   
</b>   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
<b>   
</b>   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.

             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his

             bring in fifty thousand for bail in

<b>

</b>             He won't - I mean, he didn't the last

</b>   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something

   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
<b>   
</b>   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   MAX CHERRY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
<b>   
</b>   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
<b>   
</b>   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
<b>   
</b>   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
<b>   
</b>   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             What are you doin'?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             I'm getting out of here. What do you
             think?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Lemme have the bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Fuck you. I can carry it.
<b>   
</b>   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
             fuckin' bag?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Gimme that bag before I knock you out
             and take it.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
             wrong with you?
<b>   
</b>   He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
   them.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I'm carrying it.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
<b>   
</b>   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Fuck you with your chill pill.
<b>   
</b>   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Remember where we came in?
<b>   
</b>   Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>                   (like a teacher on Romper
                   Room)
             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
             in through Bullocks. I know where it
             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
<b>   
</b>   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
   smirk, follows behind.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie follows close behind.
<b>   
</b>   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
<b>   
</b>   Louis doesn't answer.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie laughs.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Jesus, but if you two aren't the
             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
<b>   
</b>   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
<b>   
</b>   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Yeah, down the end.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b>   They walk it; it's not it.
<b>   
</b>   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
</b>             Is it this aisle or the next one
             over?
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             This one.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             You sure?
<b>   
</b>   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
             telling you, keep your mouth shut.
<b>   
</b>   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MELANIE
</b>             Okay, Lou-is.
<b>   
</b>   That did it!
<b>   
</b>   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
<b>   
</b>   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
<b>   
</b>   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
<b>   
</b>   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
<b>   
</b>   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
<b>   
</b>   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
<b>   
</b>   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             Hey, look. I found it!
<b>   
</b>   He drives away.

</b><b>                                               CUT TO:

</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
</b><b>   
</b><b>   "TIME: 4:04"
</b><b>   
</b>   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
<b>   
</b>   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Can I show you something?
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
<b>   
</b><b>                       SALESGIRL
</b>             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks, I won't.
<b>   
</b>   She goes off.
<b>   
</b>   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX (CONT'D)
</b>                   (low)
             And away we go.
<b>   
</b>   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
<b>   
</b>   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
<b>   
</b>   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
<b>   
</b>   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
<b>   
</b>   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
<b>   
</b>   Max continues his fake browsing.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
<b>   
</b>   She and Louis disappear.
<b>   
</b>   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
<b>   
</b>   She's gone.
<b>   
</b>   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
<b>   
</b>   It's Max's turn.
<b>   
</b>   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
<b>   
</b>   Max takes a few moments...
<b>   
</b>   ... then walks over to Amy.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Thanks.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
<b>   
</b>   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             Got 'em, thanks.
<b>   
</b><b>                       AMY
</b>             Sure thing.
<b>   
</b>   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
<b>   
</b><b>   
</b><b>   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
</b><b>   
</b>   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
<b>   
</b>   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
<b>   
</b>   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.

<b>   
</b><b>                       LOUIS
</b>             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.

             that woman.

</b>   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
<b>   
</b>   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.

             No - I did wonder what he was doing
             there, but didn't think it had
             anything to do with us. You know like
             maybe he was there with his wife or

<b>   
</b>   Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
   staring at Ordell.
<b>   
</b>   Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
   Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.

</b>   This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
   He slumps over - his life gone.

</b>             You didn't. I would think with all

             after.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
             with fifty thousand, and go home.

             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my

             that's where you were last time, but
             you weren't there. How the hell else
             am I supposed to let anybody know

             to do that, did you? I knew I was

</b>             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend
             shot him twice at point blank range.

</b>             We pick up Ordell. We've got three

             the storage unit where he keeps his
             guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
             warrant to go in and get him. And we

</b>             I have no evidence of your taking
             anything. You didn't pay for your
             snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
             was glad to see that. You've been
             helping us out, you gave us Melanie
             and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
             marked bills stuffed in her shorts
             when they found her, which goes a
             long way backing up your story.

             say is, you better hope we find him
             before he finds you.

<b>   
</b>   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the

   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.

</b>   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
<b>   
</b>   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
<b>   
</b>   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
<b>   
</b>   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.

</b>   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
<b>   
</b>   Max looks at Jackie.
<b>   
</b>   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.

   at him across the black Mercedes.

</b>             I didn't use you, Max.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX
</b>             I didn't say you did.
<b>   
</b><b>                       JACKIE
</b>             I never lied to you.
<b>   
</b><b>                       MAX

</b><b>                       JACKIE

<b>   
</b>   He shakes his head 'no.'

</b><b>                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>             'd feel a whole lot better if you

</b><b>          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
<b>          
</b><b>          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
<b>          
</b>          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
<b>          
</b>          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 RIDER
</b>                    Hey -- sorry.
<b>          
</b>          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 KAT
</b>                    Leave it 
<b>          
</b>          He persists.
<b>          
</b>                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
<b>          
</b>          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BIANCA
</b>                    Did you change your hair?
<b>          
</b><b>                                 CHASTITY 
</b>                    No.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BIANCA
</b>                    You might wanna think about it
<b>          
</b>          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
<b>          
</b><b>          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BOY
</b>                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 GIRL
</b>                    Awesome shoes.
<b>          
</b>          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
<b>          
</b><b>          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
<b>          
</b>          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
<b>          
</b><b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    I don't think so, ma'am
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
<b>          
</b>          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
<b>          
</b>          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
<b>          
</b>          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    I missed you.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    With the teeth of your zipper?
<b>          
</b>          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MICHAEL

</b><b>                                 CAMERON

</b><b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
<b>          
</b>          They head out of the office

</b><b>                                 MICHAEL

</b><b>                                 CAMERON

</b>                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
<b>          
</b>          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled

          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."

          inches out of his seat toward the window.

</b>                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
<b>

          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
<b>          
</b>          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat

</b>          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.

                    I've always wanted to show you.
<b>          
</b>          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
<b>          
</b>          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.

</b>          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
<b>          
</b>          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
<b>          
</b>          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MR. CHAPIN 
</b>                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
<b>          
</b>          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
<b>          
</b>          Kat smiles at him.
<b>

</b>          TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes
          through a suburban neighborhood.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck
          pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears
          over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The
          boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.
          Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a
          TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys
          cautiously look around and whisper.

</b>                     No. But that doesn't mean they're
                     not here.
<b>          
</b>          After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking
          towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their
          safety.
<b>          
</b>                               RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                     Jacob, come on. It's cool.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits
          Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and
          debris come flying at him.
<b>          
</b>          As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his
          mask. He quickly runs for the tree.
<b>          
</b>          TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come
          running out of the woods, rocks in hand.
<b>          
</b>          Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are
          nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a
          DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and
          unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

</b><b>          
</b>          Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,
          screaming. They try to shake the urine off.
<b>          
</b>          Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up
          to the boys.
<b>

</b>                       No. Anosmia is when a person
                       looses their sense of smell. It's
                       not uncommon in patients who suffer
                       serious head injuries.
                       Unfortunately, it's also affecting
                       his ability to taste. Again, not
                       uncommon.

</b>                       Leonard's association with food is
                       no longer about taste. It's about
                       texture. While we may be partial
                       to sweet or salty foods, Leonard
                       will become partial to crunchy or
                       smooth ones. Once he settles on a
                       texture he likes, his appetite will
                       increase.

                       relive the pain. It's called
                       repression. Our bodies are not so
                       forgiving, however. Inside, we

                       because I thought they were out of

                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was
                       magic. But when I came home to
                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I

                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have

<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY
</b>
	CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

	YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

<b>				P.A. SYSTEM
</b>		Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.

<b>	INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
<b>				PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
</b>		--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

	COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.

	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
<b>	FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
</b><b>	ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
</b><b>	"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
</b><b>	"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.
</b>
	Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.

	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

	JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!

<b>				JOSE
</b>		"Volunteers" again.

	JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.

<b>				SCARFACE
</b>		"Volunteer duty".

    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I didn't volunteer.

<b>				SCARFACE
</b>		You causing trouble again?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(controls his temper)
		No trouble.

<b>	INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
	in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.

<b>			TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE
</b>
	COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		All openings must be closed.

	COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		If the integrity of the suit is compromised
		in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
		not closed, readmittance will be denied.

<b>	INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
	steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door
	clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker
	now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.

	On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
	COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It

<b>	INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks
	down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.

	The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.

<b>	INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through

	RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.

	The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.

	Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.

<b>	EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
</b>
	A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
	aside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in
	moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people
	anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.

<b>	EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
<b>	
</b>	Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
	something.  Finds it.  An insect.

	COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it
	into a collection tube, something makes him turn.

	There's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.

	COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the
	light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
<b>	
</b>	Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
	flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.

<b>	INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
	floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!

	The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.

	Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More
	dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!

<b>	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
</b>
	A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
	and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.

	Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
	buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.

<b>	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
</b>
	COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large
	SPIDER tries to hide from the light.

	COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
	puts it into one of his specimen tubes.

	Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's
	nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.

<b>	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN
</b>
	As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
	building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.

	COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
	logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is
	written, "WE DID IT!"

	COLE looks up.

	COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION
	patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.

<b>			TTTLES END
</b>
<b>	INT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
	wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.

<b>	INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
	long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
	FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
	windowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
	dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,

				AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
		Raise your arms above your head.

	COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.

<b>	INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</b>
	Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
	in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
	blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.

	COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
	plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
	behind the translucent aperture, studying him.

	The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.

<b>	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.

	COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
	a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
	heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
	string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
	dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
	books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
	table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
	BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent
	a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
	outdated, patched-together technologies.

<b>				TINY
</b>		James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		Thank you.  You two wait outside.

<b>				SCARFACE
</b>		He's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

	COLE'S eyes return to the walls.

	Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!"

<b>				SCARFACE
</b>		Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		I don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're
		not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

	COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, sir.

	The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

	COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		We want you to tell us about last
		night.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I went to the surface and I collected
		specimens like I was told.

	The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(worried)
		I mashed the spider, didn't I?

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		We'll get to the spider later, Mr.
		Cole.  Right now, we want to know
		everything that you saw.

<b>	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
	sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.

<b>				ASTPOPHYSICIST
</b>		Where you collected sample #4, what
		street was that?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh...

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		It's important to observe everything.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

	As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
	COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
	wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features
	a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
	and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Close your eyes, Cole.

	Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.

	BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us in detail what you've seen in
		this room.

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, in this room?  Uh...

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		How many of us are there?

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Six...seven, if you count me.

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, you mean the newspapers?

				A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
		Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you
		hear my voice?  What do I look like?
		What does he look like, the man who
		just spoke?  How old were you when you
		left the surface?

	The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
	SYSTEM at the airport.

<b>	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked
	by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
	land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
	leading to the departure gates.

				P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
		Flight 784 now boarding at gate...

	Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
	monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
	to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
	averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
	Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.

<b>				MR. PONYTAIL
</b><b>		WATCH IT!
</b>
	YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
	the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.

	Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"

	YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
	TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
	running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
	up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
<b>	
</b><b>				TERRIFIED TRAVELER
</b>		Just exactly why did you volunteer?

<b>	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)
</b>
	COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Wake up, Cole.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, I didn't hear the...

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>			(tapping a pencil on the table)
		I asked you, why did you volunteer?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me
		I volunteered.

	The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.

	COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
	the ENGINEER speaks to him.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		We appreciate you volunteering.  You're
		a very good observer, Cole.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, thank you.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		You'll get a reduction in sentence.

	COLE keeps his face impassive.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		To be determined by the proper authorities.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
		do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, sir!

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		We have a very advanced program, something
		very different, requires very skilled people.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		An opportunity to reduce your sentence
		considerably...

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		And possibly play an important role in
		returning the human race to the surface
		of the earth.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		We want tough minded people.  Strong
		mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes
		with "unstable" types.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		For a man in your position...an opportunity.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>			(tapping his pencil again)
		Definitely a mistake!

	COLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices.
	He stares at the tapping pencil.

<b>	INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT
</b>
	A strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings
	adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
	glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
	seated on folding chairs.

<b>				POET
</b>		Still among the myriad microwaves, the
		infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
		and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
		small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
		science lurking in some vague electricity
		where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
		voice of that poet telling us,
		"We are no other than a moving row
		Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
		Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
		In Midnight by the Master of the show."

	As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
	JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
	eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And
	it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!

				POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
		"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
		Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit
		Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
		Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."

	BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
	looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
	beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,
	the glaring POET continues...

<b>				POET
</b>		"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
		Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
		Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:
		Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where."

<b>	INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
	DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.

<b>				FRANKI
</b>		-- so they get there and they ask the guy
		real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
		agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
		Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
		doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
		alla that stuff.  All they got was his
		name.  They figure he's stoned out of
		his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
		episode, so they're gonna bring him...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		He's been tested for drugs?

<b>				FRANKI
</b>		Negative for drugs.  But he took on
		five cops like he was dusted to the
		eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?

	FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
	glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in
	strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
	cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You have him in restraints.

<b>				FRANKI
</b>		Were you listening?  We got two officers in
		the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
		the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
		a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks
	right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		That would explain the bruises, I
		guess.  The struggle.

<b>				FRANKI
</b>		You want to go in?  Examine him?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...

<b>				FRANKI
</b>			(unlocking the door)
		James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None
		of the James Coles on the computer match him.
		No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.
		You want me to go in with you?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(entering)
		No, thank you.

<b>				FRANKI
</b>		I'll be right here...just in case.

<b>	INT.  ISOLATION CELL
</b>
	COLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid
	colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
	and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.
		I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the
		County -- I don't work for the police.
		My only concern is your well being --
		do you understand that?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I need to go now.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm
		not going to lie to you.  I can't make
		the police let you go...but I do want
		to help you.  And I want you to trust
		me.  Can you do that, James?  May I
		call you "James"?

<b>				COLE
</b>		"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(frowns, studies him)
		Have you been a patient at County?
		Have I seen you someplace?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, not possible.  Listen, I have to
		get out of here.  I'm supposed to be
		getting information.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What kind of information?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It won't help you.  You can't do anything
		about it.  You can't change anything.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Change what?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I need to go.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Do you know why you're here, James.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Because I'm a good observer.  Because I
		have a tough mind.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I see.  You don't remember assaulting a
		police officer...several officers?

<b>				COLE
</b>		They wanted identification.  I don't have
		any identification.  I wasn't trying to
		hurt them.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You don't have a driver's license,
		James?  Or a Social Security card?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAILLY
</b>		Why not?  Most people have some ID.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You wouldn't understand.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You've been in an institution, haven't
		you, James?  A hospital?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I have to go.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		A jail?  Prison?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Underground.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Hiding?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I love this air.  This is wonderful air.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What's wonderful about the air, James?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It's so clean.  No germs.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You're afraid of germs?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I have to go.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Why do you think there aren't any germs
		in the air, James?

<b>				COLE
</b>		This is April, right?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		July.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(sudden panic)
		July?!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Do you know what year it is?

<b>				COLE
</b>		What year is it?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What year do you think it is?

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		1995?
</b>
<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You think it's July of 1995?  That's
		the future, James.  Do you think you're
		living in the future?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(slightly confused)
		No, 1995 is the past.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.

	COLE looks stunned.

<b>	INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING
</b>
	COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
	ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Where are you taking me?

<b>				POLICEMAN #1
</b>		South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.
		You're gonna love it.

<b>				COLE
</b>		South of France?!  I don't want to go
		to the South of France.  I want to make
		a telephone call.

	POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.

<b>				POLICEMAN #2
</b>		Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
		with your act, but you don't fool us.

	Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
	overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.

<b>	EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY
</b>
	A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
	prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department
	logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.

<b>	INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)
</b>
	Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE
	stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
	PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.

	As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
	starts inspecting his scalp...

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
		got any creepy crawlies.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I need to make a telephone call.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>			(pulling Cole's head)
		Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
		Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.

<b>				COLE
</b>		It's very important.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
		easy, relax into things.  We all gonna
		get along fine if you just relax.

	COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
	lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.

<b>	INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)
</b>
	COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
	large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
	light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
	COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.

	PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
	at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.

	BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
	a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.
		Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV
		rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(with a sly look)
		How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd
		be doing your job.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Five thousand dollars, my man.  That
		enough?  I'll wire it to your account
		as usual, okay?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Okay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's
		enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll
		give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.

	As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Kid around, kid around.  It makes them feel
		good, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're
		the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?

	COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
	playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Here's the games.  Games vegitize you.
		If you play the games, you're
		voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

	COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
	THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How
		much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I need to make a telephone call.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		A telephone call?  That's communication
		with the outside world!  Doctor's
		discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts
		could just make phone calls, it could
		spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone
		cables, oozing into the ears of all those
		poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos
		everywhere!  A plague of madness.
			(suddenly sly and confidential)
		In fact, very few of us here are actually
		mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're
		not mentally ill, for all I know you're
		crazy as a loon.  But that's not why
		you're here.  Why you're here is because
		of the system, because of the economy.
			(indicating the TV)
		There's the TV.  It's all right there.
		Commercials.  We are not productive
		anymore, they don't need us to make
		things anymore, it's all automated.  What
		are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,
		buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
		But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
		know what?  You're mentally ill! That's
		a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet
		paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
		electrically operated sexual devices...
			(getting hysterical)
<b>		SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
</b><b>		RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
</b><b>		BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
</b><b>		ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
</b>
	A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.

<b>				TERRY
</b>		Take it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.

	Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
	continues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's
	mesmerized by the TV.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		So if you want to watch a particular
		program, say "All My Children" or
		something, you go to the Charge Nurse
		and tell her what day and time the show
		you want to see is on.  But you have to
		tell her before the show is scheduled
		to be on.  There was this one guy who
		was always requesting shows that had already
		played.  He couldn't quite grasp the
		idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
		just make it be yesterday for him, turn
		back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!

	This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
	he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Seriously, more and more people are
		being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?
		Because they're not consuming on their
		own.  But as patients, they becone
		consumers of mental health care.  And
		this gives the so-called sane people work!
			(hysteria again)
<b>		WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!
</b><b>		HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!
</b><b>		IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE
</b><b>		SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...
</b>
<b>				TERRY
</b>		Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
		get a shot.  I warned you...

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(calming himself, smiling)
		Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.
		I got "carried away".  Explaining the
		workings of...the institution.

	Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a
	bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.

<b>				TJ WASHINGTON
</b>		I don't really come from outer space.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he
		doesn't really come from outer space.

<b>				TJ WASHINGTON
</b>		Don't mock me, my friend.
			(to Cole)
		It's a condition of "mental divergence".
		I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
		part of an intellectual elite, preparing
		to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.
		But even though it's a totally convincing
		reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,
		hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a
		construct of my psyche.  I am mentally
		divergent in that I am escaping certain
		unnamed realities that plague my life
		here.  When I stop going there, I will
		be well.  Are you also divergent, friend?

	The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.

				P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
		James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Staff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now the
		geniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!

<b>	INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</b>
	COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.

<b>				COLE
</b>		This is a place for crazy people!  I'm
		not crazy!

	RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
	friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
	around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing
	the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORS
	bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)

<b>				RESIDENT #1
</b>		We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Well, you've got some real nuts in here!
		Listen to me, all of you -- I have to
		tell you something that's going to be
		difficult for you to understand, but...

<b>				DR. RAILLY
</b>		James...please.  These are all doctors
		here and we want to help you.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.
		Railly you thought it was...
			(checking a file)
		1995. ... How about right now?  Do you
		know what year it is right now?

<b>				COLE
</b>		1989.  Look, I'm not confused.  There's been
		a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.

	Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE
	is just grabbing a pad and pencil.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

	FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(drawing)
		Do any of you know anything about the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint
		this, stencil it, on buildings, all
		over the place.

	COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.

<b>				DR. CASEY
</b>		Mr. Cole...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Right.  I guess you wouldn't, this is
		1989, they're probably not active yet.
		That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,
		three billion people died in 1995.
		Three billion, got that?  Almost
		the whole population.  Of the world!
		Only about one percent survived.

	DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.

<b>				RESIDENT #2
</b>		Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Save you?  How can I save you?  It
		already happened!  I can't save you.  I'm
		simply trying to get some information for
		people in the present so that someday...
			(sees their eyes)
		You don't believe me.  You think I'm
		crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  I'm a convict,
		sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as
		sane as anyone in this room.  I...

	COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLE'S seen
	that tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.

<b>				DR. RAILLY
</b>		Can you tell us the name of the prison
		you've come from?

	COLE doesn't answer.  He's staring at the tapping pencil.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(recovering, new tack)
		No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I
		need to do is make a telephone call to
		straighten everything out.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would
		straighten everything out?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in
		to them.  They'll want to know they
		sent me to the wrong time.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		So you could talk to these scientists
		and they do what?  Send you to the future?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called,
		"voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages.
		They monitor it from the present.

<b>				RESIDENT #2
</b>		"From the present."  We're not in the
		present now, Mr. Cole?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, no.  This is the past.  This has
		already happened.  Listen...

<b>				RESIDENT #3
</b>		Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's
		the present, is that it?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they
		doctors like ourselves?

	Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.

<b>				COLE
</b>		No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given
		a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.
		You have to let me use the phone.  One call!

	COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.

<b>	INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
	insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
	lunges for the phone, answers sharply...

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		Yes?
			(listens, frowns, then)
		Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know
		what you're talkin' about. ... Is this
		a joke?  I don't know any scientists.
		James who?  Never heard of you!

	The MOTHER slams down the phone.

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
	A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,
	RAILLY takes it from him.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It wasn't who you expected?

	COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Perhaps it was a wrong number...

<b>				COLE
</b>		No.  That's the reason they chose me --
		I remember things.

	RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
	It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,
	detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, where did you grow up?  Was it
		around here?  Around Baltimore?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(lost in thought)
		What?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I have the...strangest feeling I've met
		you before...a long time ago, perhaps.
		Were you ever...?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed
		to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's
		not the right number yet.  That's the
		problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?

	RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,
	pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, take these.
			(watching him step back)
		Please -- I helped you like I said I
		would.  Now I want you to trust me.

<b>	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)
</b>
	MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.

<b>				MR. PONYTAIL
</b><b>		WATCH IT!
</b>
	Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was
	definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.

	TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...

<b>				WOMAN'S VOICE
</b><b>		NOOOOOOOOOO!
</b>
	The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but
	doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!

	Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's
	the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's
	sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his
	moustache slightly askew!

	A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
	Everything goes white!

<b>	INT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
	COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.

	He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.
	Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,
	occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
	an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.

	His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.

	He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.

	With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of
	bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.

	COLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single
	tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.

	ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It won't work. You can't open it.

	Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You think you can remove the grill but
		you can't.  It's welded.

	COLE checks the grill anyway.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are
		locked, too.  They're protecting the
		people on the outside from us.  But the
		people outside are as crazy as us.

	COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
	the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a
	sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed
	just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
	the blade of his flashlight.

	ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.

	The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.

	For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
	SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
	whisper, picking up right where he left off.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is
		"majority rules".  Take germs for example.

	Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
	out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!

<b>				COLE
</b>		Germs?!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		In the 18th century there was no such
		thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a
		thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along
		comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I
		think.  He tries to convince people...
		other doctors mostly...that there are
		these teeny tiny invisible "bad things"
		called germs that get into your body and
		make you...sick!  He's trying to get
		doctors to wash their hands.  What is
		this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible
		whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!

	As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to
	figure out where to put the SPIDER.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		So cut to the 20th century!  Last week
		in fact, right before I got dragged
		into this hellhole.  I order a burger
		in this fast food joint.  The waiter
		drops it on the floor.  He picks it up,
		wipes it off, hands it to me...like it
		was all okay.

	No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows
	it as JEFFREY prattles on...

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		"What about the germs?"  I say.  He
		goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs
		are just a plot they made up so they
		can sell you disinfectants and soap!"
		Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you
		believe in germs, don't you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I'm not crazy.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Of course not, I never thought you were.
		You want to escape, right?  That's very
		sane.  I can help you.  You want me to,
		don't you?  Get you out?

<b>				COLE
</b>		If you know how to escape, why don't you...?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Why don't I escape, that's what you
		were going to ask me, right?  'Cause
		I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken
		care of, see?  I've sent out word.

<b>				COLE
</b>		What's that mean?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		I've managed to contact certain underlings,
		evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
		assorted minions, who will contact my father.
		When he learns I'm in this kind of place,

	PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
	dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little
		agitated.  The thought of escaping

		I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
<b>		BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW

</b><b>		THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...
</b>
	COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient!
		I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you

<b>	INT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING
</b>
	ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing
	pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached
	to his tiny, restrained body.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with
	crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty
	robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Torture!  Experiments!  We're all
		monkeys

	COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes
	the seat next to him.

<b>				COLE
</b>		They hurt you!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Not as bad as what they're doing to
		kitty.

	ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,
	eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.

				TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)
		These video tapes were obtained by
		animal rights activists who worked
		underground as laboratory assistants
		for several months.  Authorities say
		there is little they can do until...

	The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of
	their experiments passively.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Look at those assholes, they're asking
		for it!  Maybe people deserved to be
		wiped out!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(startled, turning)
		Wiping cut the human race!  That's a
		great idea!  But it's more of a long
		term thing -- right now we have to
		focus on more immediate goals.
			(sudden whisper)
		I didn't say a word about "you know
		what".

<b>				COLE
</b>		What are you talking about???

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You know -- your plan.

	As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		What're you writing?  You a reporter?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(shielding the magazine)
		It's private.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?

	Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Yo, James -- time to take your meds.

<b>	INT.  DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING)
</b>
	ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps
	in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...

				NARRATOR (v.o.)
		Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine.
		Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys!

	ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with
	other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.

	ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.

				TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)
		We'll return to the Marx Brothers in
		"Monkey Business" following these
		messages.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business.

	COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.
<b>	
</b><b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk!
			(big grin)
		Key!

	JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY!

<b>				COLE
</b>			(groggy)
		What....???

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.
		Major load!  Listen up -- try and get
		it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan!
		Remember?  I did my part.

<b>				COLE
</b>		What...???

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Not, "what", babe!  When!

		"When???"

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(pressing the key into Cole's hand)
		Now!

				VOICE/TV (o.s.)
		Let us guide you to the stocks and
		bonds that will enhance your portfolio.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(leaping to his feet)
<b>		YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS!
</b><b>		NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.
</b>
	ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a
	BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.

				VOICE/TV (v.o.)
		A portfolio tailored to your specific
		needs and the needs of your loved ones...

	ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!
</b>
	ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go
	of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a
	beeper, calling for help.

	ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!
</b>
	ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE
	KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the
	puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just
	completed the puzzle stares, very upset.

	Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a
	lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.

<b>				HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT
</b><b>		I'M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP!
</b>
<b>				SKINNY MAN PATIENT
</b><b>		HERE THEY COME!  THEY'RE COMING!
</b>
<b>				OLD MAN PATIENT
</b><b>		FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE

</b><b>		FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES!
</b><b>		YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!
</b>
	ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY
	is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door.

	COLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
	One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached
	to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW'S THE
</b><b>		TIME!  GO FOR IT!
</b>
<b>				BILLINGS
</b>			(missing a tackle)
		God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.

	ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in
	and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY
	resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!
</b>
	ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to
	insert the key in the lock.

	ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.

	ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.

	ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won't turn.

	A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.

<b>				PATIENT
</b>		Place to go would be...Florida.  The
		keys are lovely this tine of year.

	COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns.

<b>				PATIENT
</b>		Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.

	COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door.

<b>	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
</b>
	Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room
	facing several elevators.

	A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even
	lock up from the magazine he's reading.

	Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his
	back is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesn't know how to control
	this elevator.  What should he do?

				SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Two's not working today.  Use one.

	COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  He's a big
	guy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactly
	like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!

	ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!

	Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevator's empty.

	COLE steps into it.

<b>	INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
</b>
	The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.

	COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator
	springs to life.  The numbers on the indicator over the door
	start to rise.  7...8...9.

	Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.

	Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.

	COLE hesitates.

	They look at him.  They seem to expect him to exit.

	Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.

	As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
	RAILLY has just arrived for work.  She's slipping on her white
	doctor's coat when...

	DR. CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the
	door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.

<b>				DR. CASEY
</b>		This was in my box, but I have a slight
		suspicion it wasn't meant for me.

	CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.

<b>				DR. CASEY
</b>		"You are the most beautiful woman I have
		ever seen.  You live in a beautiful
		world.  But you don't know it.  You have
		freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(smiling)
		Cole.  James Cole -- right?

	She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.

<b>				DR. CASEY
</b>		"I would do anything to stay here, but
		I must leave.  Please, help me."

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Poor man...

	CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS,
	sticks his head in the door.  He's upset.

<b>				DR. GOODINS
</b>		Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of
		yours, right?

	RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.

<b>				DR. GOODINS
</b>		He got out.  Took off.  Last seen, he
		was up on nine.

<b>    INT.  X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY
</b>
    A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,
    while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.

<b>				DOCTOR
</b>		Just relax -- don't fight it.  We have
		to know exactly what's there so we can...

	The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.

	It's COLE!  He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.

	The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.

<b>				DOCTOR
</b>		Eh, excuse me.  Can I help you?

	COLE turns and rushes back out the door.

<b>	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
</b>
	COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.

	A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.

	COLE turns to his left.

	Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.

	COLE'S trapped.  A beat.  He attacks the nearest man.  BILLINGS.

<b>	INT.  TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)
</b>
	RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on
	a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense
	for more trouble.  One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It's just a shot to calm you.

<b>				COLE
</b>		No more drugs.  Please...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I have to do this, James.  You're very
		confused.

	RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.

<b>	INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)
</b>
	DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR.
	CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't
		an inquisition.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I didn't think I was being defensive.
		I was just...

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		He should have been in restraints.  It
		was bad judgment on your part, plain
		and simple.  why not just cop to it?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have
		the strangest feeling about him -- I've
		seen him somewhere and...

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>			(impatient, not interested)
		Two policemen were already in the
		hospital and now we have an orderly
		with a broken arm and a Security
		Officer with a fractured skull.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I said it was bad judgment!  What else
		do you want me to say?

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.
			(to Dr. Casey)
		Isn't she being defensive, Bob?

	But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...
		situation.

<b>	INT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
</b>
	DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,
	GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		He was in full restraints?  And the
		door was locked?

<b>				BILLINGS
</b>		Yes, sir.  Did it myself.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		And he was fully sedated?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		He was fully sedated!

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Then are you trying to tell me that a
		fully sedated, fully restrained patient
		somehow slipped out that vent, replaced
		the grill behind him and that he's wriggling
		through the ventilation system right now?

	DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.

<b>	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
</b>
	Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into
	the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...

<b>				P.A. SYSTEM
</b>		Flight 784 to San Francisco now
		boarding at Gate 38...

	YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.

	MR. PONYTAIL bumps him.

	The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!

<b>				WOMAN'S VOICE
</b><b>		NOOOOOOOOOO!
</b>
	TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE
	running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches
	just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except
	for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She
	calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...

<b>				BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM
</b>		The Freedom For Animals Headquarters
		now boarding on Second Avenue.  The
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole, you moron -- wake up!

<b>	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
</b>
	As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM
	continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...

<b>				UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM
</b>		-- they're the ones who are going to do it...

	COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
	in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It's
	a beat-up old tape recorder.

<b>				UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER
</b>		I can't do anything more.  The Police
		are after me.

	The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Well?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, what?

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		He's drugged out of his mind!  He's
		completely zoned out.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Cole, did you or did you not record
		that message?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, that message...me?

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		It's a digital reconstruction of a
		message, Cole, from a weak signal on our
		contact number.  Did you make that call?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(angrily)
		I couldn't call!  You sent me to the
		wrong year!  It was 1989.

<b>				SCIENTISTS
</b><b>		1989!
</b>
	The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then,

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		You're certain of that?

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>			(before Cole can answer)
		What did you do with your time, Cole?
		Did you waste it on drugs?  Women?

<b>				COLE
</b>		They forced me to take drugs.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		Forced you!  Why would someone force
		you to take drugs?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I got into trouble.  I got arrested.
		But I still got you a specimen -- a
		spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to
		put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong
		year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.

	The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing
	looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.

	Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST
	staring at COLE intently.  For one moment, the face belongs to
<b>	DR. FLETCHER!
</b>
	COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.

	COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.

				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole!

<b>	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
</b>
	COLE comes awake with a start.  The room is dark now, except...

	a slide is being projected on a torn screen.  It's a picture of a
	stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		What about it, Cole?

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		Did you see it?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, no, sir.  I...

	Another slide CLICKS into place.  Youthful PROTESTERS, their
	placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,
	confront POLICE in riot gear.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		What about these people?  Did you see
		any of these people?

	Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
	PROTESTERS.  The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
	recognize some of them later on).

				COLE (o.s.)
		Uh, no, sir, I...wait!

	The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
	PROTESTERS.  In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage
	is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Him?  You saw that man?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.

<b>				MICRO3IOLOGIST
</b>			(switching on the light)
		You were in a mental institution?!

	The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		You were sent to make very important
		observations!

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		You could have made a real contribution.

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		Helped to reclaim the planet...

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		As well as reducing your sentence.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		The question is, Cole -- "Do you want
		another chance?"

	COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.

<b>	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
</b>
	The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as
	frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey!  Who's that?

<b>	INT.  CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	COLE opens his eyes.  Where is he?  Silence as he examines the
	tiny cell.  Bare cement walls.  High ceiling.  Same color and
	size as the isolation room at the county hospital.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, Bob...what's your name?

	COLE looks around frantically.  Up, down.  Where is the VOICE
	coming from?  Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You can talk!  Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
		Volunteer?

<b>				COLE
</b>		My name's not "Bob".

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not a prob, Bob.  Where'd they send you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Another cell. ...  Maybe.

<b>				COLE
</b>		What do you mean, "maybe"?  What's that
		supposed to mean?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Maybe.  Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell,
		another "volunteer" like you -- or "maybe"
		I'm in the Central Office spying on you
		for all those science bozos.  Or, hey, "maybe"
		I'm not even here.  "Maybe" I'm just in
		your head.  No way to confirm anything.
		Ha Ha.  Where'd they send you?

	COLE doesn't answer.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not talking, huh, Bob?  That's okay
		I can handle that.

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		1989.
</b>
				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)

		pussy?  Hey, Bob, you do the job?  D'ju
		find out the "big info"?...Army of the
		Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was
		prior to mutation?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It was supposed to be 1995.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Science isn't an exact science with
		these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't
		end up in ancient Egypt!

<b>	INT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
</b>
	COLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by,
	whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		No mistakes this time, Cole.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open.

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
		Try and do something like that again.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We
		have to know exactly what's there so we
		can fix it.

	The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...
	reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.

	COLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber
	door is CLANGED shut.

<b>	EVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE

	DRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
	eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS
	in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
	COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
	fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
	in FRENCH.  COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
	Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Where's your mask?!  And your clothes...
		and your weapon, you idiot?!

<b>				COLE
</b>		What?  What??

	COLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
	stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter
	close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the
	foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut!

<b>				COLE
</b>		I don't understand.  Where am I?

	The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.

<b>				CAPTAIN

		How'd you get here, soldier?  What's
		your rank?  Where are your clothes?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I...don't understand.

		German!  Speak German!  What are you
		doing here?

				VOICE (o.s.)
			(pleading in English)
		I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em.
		Please, you gotta help me!

	COLE turns, sees...

	It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
	the "underground" time.  He's being carried past COLE now on a
	stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		JOSE!
</b>
<b>				JOSE
</b>		Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

	JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
	PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY,
	SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg!

	SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.

	Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
	from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.

	COLE is reaching for the mask when...

</b>
	A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is
	a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in
	apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained
	by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
	of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		According to the accounts of local
		officials at that time, this gentleman,
		judged to be about forty years of age,
		appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
		near Stonehenge in the West of England in
		April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and
		speaking in a strange accent, the man made
		dire prognostications about a pestilence
		which he predicted would wipe out humanity
		in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and
		hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
		village, was taken into custody, but then
		mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.

	WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
	in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
	engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
	scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
	audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.

					RAILLY (cont.)
		In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons
		of great pestilence, men have often
		believed the prophecies of crazed
		fanatics, that the end of the world was
		come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday
		scenario is considerably more compelling
		when reality supports it in some form,
		whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
		or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural"
		contagions, there are now technological
		horrors as well:  besides radiation,
		consider our lurking fear of germ
		warfare and its close approximation,
		chemical warfare, which first reared
		its ugly head in the deadly mustard
		gas attacks during the First World War.

	ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
	SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		During such an attack in the French
		trenches in October, 1917, we have an
		account of this soldier...

	ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
	JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
	by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears
	to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
	the image approximates Munch's famous painting.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
		-- who, during an assault, was wounded
		by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
		lines where Doctors discovered he had
		lost all comprehension of French but
		spoke English fluently, albeit in a
		regional dialect they didn't recognize.
		The man, although physically unaffected
		by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed
		he had come from the future, that he was
		looking for a pure germ that would
		ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
		the earth in the year... 1995!

	The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.

	ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time
	he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		Although seriously injured, the young
		soldier disappeared from the hospital
		before more data could be gathered.  No
		doubt, he was trying to carry on his
		mission to warn others, substituting
		for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
		agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".

	As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
	RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
	attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with
	shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.

				RAILLY (cont.)
		Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,
		was condemned to know the future but to be
		disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,
		the agony of foreknowledge combined with
		impotence to do anything about it.

<b>	INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)
</b>
	A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic
	Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly

	Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is
	seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		I think, Dr. Railly, you have given
		your alarmists a bad name.  Surely
		there is very real and very convincing
		data that the planet cannot survive the
		excesses of the human race:  proliferation
		of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding
		habits, the rape of the environment, the
		pollution of land, sea, and air.  In this
		context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken
		Little" represents the sane vision and
		that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go
		shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?

	DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
	disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
<b> 
</b><b>				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
</b>		Doctor Railly -- please!  I wonder if
		you're aware of my own studies which
		indicate that certain cycles of the
		moon actually impact on the incidence
		of apocalyptic predictions as observed
		in urban emergency rooms and...

	As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE
	CHANG, appear and whisper...

<b>				MARILOU
</b>		You were great.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You're leaving?

<b>				MARILOU
</b>		The reservation's at nine thirty --
		it's getting late.

<b>				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
</b>		Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
		important!

<b>				WAYNE CHANG
</b>			(checking the professor)
		You sure you're gonna be all right?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(smiles, checks her watch)
		I'll be there in twenty minutes.

<b>				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
</b>		Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand
		your exclusion of the moon in relation
		to apocalyptic dementia...

<b>	EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
</b>
	A full moon.

	COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
	"Congratulations" to RAILLY.

	She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
	cars left in the lot.

	The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.

	RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
	purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...

	Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
	shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.

<b>				MAN'S VOICE
</b>		Get in!

	Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
	front seat.

<b>				MAN'S VOICE
</b>		I've got a gun.

	RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
	scrambles in behind her.

<b>	INT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT
</b>
	Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You can have my purse.  I have a lot of
		cash and credit...

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Start the car.

	Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes
	peering out of the shadows, no other features.

	Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Here!  You can have the keys.  You can...

	He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely
	into her ear, his face last in shadow.

<b>				MAN
</b><b>		START THE CAR!  NOW!
</b>
<b>	EXT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT
</b>
	The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.

<b>	INT.  ACURA
</b>
	Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I don't want to hurt you.  But I will.
		I've hurt people before when...when I
		had no choice.  Turn left.

	As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,
	sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darkness
	but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the
	map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Where... where are we going'

<b>				MAN
</b>		I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(startled, horrified)
		But that's... that's more than 200 miles!

<b>				MAN
</b>		That's why I can't walk there.  Turn
		here... I think...

	RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then
	boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully
	for his reaction.

	He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirror
	again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features
	are concealed by the map.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		If you make me go with you, it's
		kidnapping.  That's a serious crime.
		If you let me go, you could just take
		the car and...

<b>				MAN
</b>		I don't know how to drive!  We went
		underground when I was nine, I told you
		that.  When you come to the corner,
		turn right.

	Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.

	He's lowered the map.  It's COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a
		locked room six years ago.

<b>				COLE
</b>		1989.  Six years for you.  There's the
		sign!  Right here!

	COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.

	RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.

<b>	EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.

<b>	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily
	against the seat.  She says carefully...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I can't believe this is a coincidence,
		Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

<b>				COLE
</b>		You told me you'd help me.  I know this
		isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...
		no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.
		I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.
		But then I saw your book in a store window
		with a notice about your lecture.
			(sudden pride)
		I can read, remember?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Yes, I remember.
			(a beat, then)
		Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It's the next step.  I checked out the
		Baltimore information, it was nothing.
		It's Philadelphia, that's where they
		are, the ones who killed everyone.
			(pointing suddenly, eagerly)
		Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?

	RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
	and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)
		This is a personal message to you.

	COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Are you at the end of your rope?  Are
		you dying to get away?

	COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.

				COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}
		The Florida Keys are waiting for you.

	COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
	the car.  It's confusing!  He blurts out...

<b>				COLE
</b>		I've never seen the ocean!

	Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her
	professional tone.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You
		do understand that, don't you?  It's
		not really a special message to you.

	COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You used to call me "James".

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You'd prefer that? ... James...you
		don't really have a gun, do you.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(cynical laugh)
		Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...

	He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing
	"BLUEBERRY HILL"!  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Can you...can you make it louder?  I
		love hearing twentieth century music!
		Hearing music and breathing air!

	As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror
	incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the
	wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.

<b>	EXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT
</b>
	"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
	window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.

	The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."

<b>	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his
	head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she's
	trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in...

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		This just in from Fresno, California:
		emergency crews are converging on a
		cornfield where playmates of nine year
		old Ricky Neuman say they saw him
		disappear right before their eyes.

	COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
		abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
		in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,
		possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim
		they heard him cry out faintly but since then
		there has been no contact with...

<b>				COLE
</b>		"Never cry wolf!"

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What?

<b>				COLE
</b>		My father told me that.  "Never cry
		wolf."  Then people won't believe you
		if...something really happens.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		"If something really happens"...like
		what, James?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Something bad.  Is that all the music?
		I don't want to hear this stuff...

	RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Did something terrible happen to you when
		you were a child?  Something so bad...?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

	It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY".

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)
		"Since I met you, baby,
		My whole life has changed...

	Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.

<b>	EXT.  ACURA/FREEWAY
</b>
	COLE'S POV:  the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
	lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		"-- cause since I met you, baby.
		All I need is you..."

	ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
	Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an
	answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.

<b>				ANSWERING MACHINE
</b>		Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych
		Admitting.  There was a guy here this
		afternoon looking for you.  He seemed
		very agitated.  We tried to keep him, but
		he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know
		this guy.  Then, just a few minutes ago,
		it came to me.  It's Cole!  James Cole.
		Remember him?  The paranoid who pulled
		the Houdini back in '89.  Well, he's
		back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking
		for you.  I thought you oughta know.

	The machine switches off.  The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.

<b>				MARILOU MARTIN
</b>		It's just as I told you -- my husband
		and I had gone ahead -- she never
		showed.  That's totally unlike her!

<b>				OFFICER TWO
</b>			(pulls out his notebook)
		Do you happen to know the make of her car?

<b>				MARILOU MARTIN
</b>		Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that
		cat's starving!  She would never neglect
		her cat!

<b>	EXT.  MOTEL - MORNING
</b>
	The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS
	MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.

<b>	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46
</b>
	The TV is on.  A commercial is just starting.  A catfood jingle.

	The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side
	of the double bed, sound asleep.

<b>	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
</b>
	GUNSHOT!  YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.

	The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and
	YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of
	the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.

	Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Son, it's important for your cat to
		have the nourishment necessary for
		healthy bones and a rich coat.

<b>	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46
</b>
	COLE comes awake with a start.  He stares, disoriented, at the
	CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Please untie me.  I'm very uncomfortable.

	COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and
	helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.

	COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his
	impulse.  He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the
	dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons.  He pulls a
	razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the
	bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You were in my dream just now.  Your hair
		was different, but I'm sure it was you.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		We dream about what's important in our lives.
		And I seem to have become pretty important
		in yours.  What was the dream about?

<b>				COLE
</b>		About an airport...before everything
		happened.  It's the same dream I always
		have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid
		in it.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		And I was in it?  What did I do?

<b>				COLE
</b>		You were very upset.  You're always
		very upset in the dream, but I never
		knew it was you before.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It wasn't me before, James.  It's
		become me now because of...what's
		happening.  Please untie me.

	Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, I think it was always you.  It's
		very strange.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You're flushed.  And you were moaning.
		I think you're running a fever.  What
		are you doing?

	COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I'll be back in a minute.

	He heads for the door.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		No!  Don't leave me here like this!

	Too late!  He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.

	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.

<b>				TV ANCHORMAN
</b>		And in Fresno, California...crews
		continue to attempt to rescue nine year
		old Ricky Neuman.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to
	get loose, tears welling in her eyes.

				TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)
		The boy was playing ball with four
		other children when he literally
		disappeared off the face of the earth.

<b>	----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------
</b>

<b>				COLE
</b>		My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Clues?  What kind of clues?

<b>				COLE
</b>		A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve
		Monkeys.  I've told you about them.
		They spread the virus.  That's why we
		have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to
		find them -- it's my assignment.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What will you do...when you find
		this...secret army?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I just have to locate the virus in its
		original form before it mutates.  So
		scientists can come back and study it
		and find a cure.  So that those of us
		who survived can go back to the surface
		of the earth.

	RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass
	a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.

	COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You won't think I'm crazy next month.
		People are going to start dying.  At
		first the papers will say it's some
		weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll
		begin to catch on.  They'll get it.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		We interrupt this program with a
		special bulletin...

	RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		This report just in from Fresno,
		California.  Naval sonar specialists
		who were flown to the site...

<b>				COLE
</b>		I thought it was about us.  I thought
		maybe they'd found us and arrested me
		or something.

	RAILLY stares at COLE.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Just a joke.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		-- an hour ago have been unable to
		determine the location of the boy in the
		150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who
		lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into
		the narrow tube claims he heard breathing
		sounds coming from approximately seventy
		feet down...

	COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking
		about that little boy in the well?

<b>				COLE
</b>		When I was a kid I identified with that
		kid, down there alone in that pipe...a
		hundred feet down -- doesn't know if
		they're going to save him.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a
		hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn.
		Hey, turn left here.  Left!

	COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.

<b>	EXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY
</b>
	An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
	bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he
	rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.

<b>				EVANGELIST
</b>		"And the wild beasts of the islands
		shall cry in their desolate houses and
		dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and
		her time is near to come, and her days
		shall not be prolonged."

	ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
	COLE, beside her, staring out the window.

<b>	INT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET
</b>
	COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store
	fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS".

<b>				COLE
</b>		Where I come from we think of this as Eden.
		If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown
		food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut
		know what they have.  They don't see the
		sky.  They don't feel the air!

	COLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!

				COLE (o.s.)
		And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug
		they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP!

<b>	EXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW
</b>
	On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
	graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.

	Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.

	COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
	insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.

<b>				COLE
</b>		The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here.
			(looks around)
		Somewhere.  Come on!

	He pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he's insane.

	At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still
	keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
	tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.

	RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
	suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything,
		I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I'm not going to "do" anything, I
		promise.  But you need help, James.
		None of this is what you think it is.

	ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He's found
	another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!

	But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		You can't hide from them, Bob.

	COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
	voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
			(conspiratorially)
		They hear everything.  They got that
		tracking device on you.  They can find
		you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha!

	RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>			(touches his back jaw)
		In the tooth, Bob!  Right?
			(sudden triumphant grin)
		But I fooled 'em, old buddy!

	He opens his mouth wide.  NO TEETH'

	COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.

<b>				COLE
</b>		They're keeping an eye on me.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Who's keeping an eye on you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		The man...with the voice.  I recognized
		him.  He's from the present.  He...

	COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...

	there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS

	And further on, another red stencil!

<b>	EXT.  VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
</b>
	CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
	oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.

	COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.

	RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
	COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, no -- we shouldn't be here!

	COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.

<b>	INT.  DARK ALLEY - DAY
</b>
	Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.

	COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!

	RAILLY'S POV:  TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.

	RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,
	doesn't notice the THUGS.

	The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.

	These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.

	RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!  We have to go back.  Those men...

	Too late.  While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,
	the TWO THUGS are approaching.

<b>				FIRST THUG
</b>		Hey, buddy.

	Startled, COLE turns to face them.

	The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.

	COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK!  The FIRST THUG smacks
	COLE hard across the face with something metallic.

	Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his
	head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S
	cheek.  It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.

	RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
	her roughly to the ground.

<b>				SECOND THUG
</b>		Stick around, bitch.

	Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
	RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...

	COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Please!  Please don't hurt me!

	The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his
	foot for a second kick when...

	COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger
	man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.

	The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
	in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
	The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.

	Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
	but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage
	blows that come one after another with lightning speed.  The SECOND
	THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.

	Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for
	the dropped pistol.

	COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw.  The FIRST THUG'S head whips
	back.  SNAP!  He collapses against the brick wall.

	COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
	as fast as he can stagger.

	RAILLY stares up at COLE.  He looks very dangerous.  He glances
	in her direction as he pockets the pistol.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Are you hurt?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...

	As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the
	motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Is he...alive?

	COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a
	handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Come an.  We're running out of time.
		You can't help him.

	As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST
	THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!

<b>				COLE
</b>		I did him a favor.  Now come on.

	COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You didn't have a gun before, did you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I've got one now.

<b>	EXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY
</b>
	The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
	points urgently at COLE.

<b>				EVANGELIST
</b>		You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you?

	But COLE has stopped and is staring at...

	A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign
	over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.

<b>	INT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
</b>
	Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,
	and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating
	leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large
	poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO".  Just then, there's
	a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see
	COLE and RAILLY enter.

	COLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in
	here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks
	around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.

	Bookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with
	posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,
	photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the
	counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD
	SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Uh, can we help you?

	COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets
	an urgent warning.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Excuse me.  You looking for something
		in particular?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.

	COLE'S eyes follow her look.  It's a tape recorder underneath a
	sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".

<b>				COLE
</b>		I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

	FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  "We have a problem!" the look says.
	MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the
	counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		We don't know anything about any "Army
		of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't
		you and your friend disappear, okay?

	COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I just need some information...

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		Didn't you hear me?  We're not...

	TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.

	COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, no -- don't hurt them.
			(to the activists)
		Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do
		whatever he tells you to do.  He's...
		upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's
		dangerous -- just cooperate.

	MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.

<b>				FALE
</b>		What do you want -- money?  We only
		have a few bucks.

	COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A
	BABOON HOWLS with laughter.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I told you what I want.
			(snaps at Railly)
		Lock the door!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, why don't we...?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Lock it now!

	RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,

<b>				BEN
</b>		I told you that fuckhead Mason would
		get us into something like this.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Shut up!

<b>				COLE
</b>		Mason???

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Jeffrey Mason?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.

<b>	INT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</b>
	The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of
	the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They're very
	frightened, eager to cooperate.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big
		star -- the media latch on to him
		because he's picketing his own father,
		a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist".
		You musta seen all that on TV.

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, I don't watch TV.

	COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while
	RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he
	thinks he's seen before.  He holds it up.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Is this him -- Dr. Mason?

	It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a
	phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.

<b>				FALE
</b>		That's him.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(very frightened)
		What are you going to do with us?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(stares at the photo, then)
		Tell me more about Jeffrey.

<b>				FALE
</b>			(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
		Jeffrey started getting bored with the
		shit we do...picketing, leafleting,
		letter-writing stuff.  He said we were,
		"ineffectual liberal jerkoffs".  He
		wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to
		"educate" the public.

	COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
	their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Yeah, that's when he let a hundred
		snakes loose in the Senate.

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
		It's counter productive, we told him.

<b>				FALE
</b>		So he and eleven others split off and
		became this underground..."army"

<b>				COLE
</b>		The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.

<b>				BEN
</b>		They started planning a "Human Hunt".

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		They bought stun guns and nets and bear
		traps.  They were gonna go to Wall
		Street and trap lawyers and bankers...

<b>				BEN
</b>		But they didn't do it.  They didn't do
		any of it.

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot
		sold his friends out!

<b>				COLE
</b>		What's that mean?

<b>				FALE
</b>		He goes on TV, gives a news conference,
		tells the whole world he just realized
		his daddy's experiments are vital for
		humanity and that the use of animals is
		absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey
		Mason, from now on, is going to personally
		supervise the labs to make sure all the
		little animals aren't going to suffer.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(holding up a rolodex)
		What's this?

<b>	EXT.  FREEWAY - AFTERNOON
</b>
	In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with
	bumper stickers and painted slogans.  "I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"...
<b>	"FREE THE ANIMALS"..."WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?"
</b>
				RAILLY (v.o.)
		You can't just barge in on a famous
		scientist.  They'll have security guards,
		gates, alarm systems.  It's insane, James.

<b>	INT.  MOVING FORD/FREEWAY
</b>
	A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey
	Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason" rests on a map spread across COLE'S
	lap.  COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel,
	maneuvering in heavy traffic.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		If those young men don't get loose,
		they could die in that basement.

	COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing
	cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.

<b>				COLE
</b>		All I see are dead people.  Everywhere.
		What's three more?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(a beat, carefully, a new tack)
		You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey
		Mason, don't you, James?  You met him
		in the County Hospital six years ago.

	COLE is studying the map again.

<b>				COLE
</b>		The guy was a total fruitcake.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		And he told you then his father was a
		famous virologist.

	COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".

<b>				COLE
</b>		No -- he said his father was "God"!

<b>	EXT./INT.  FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)
</b>
	The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
	highway.  COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
	the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.  As
	the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	intones over the RADIO...

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
		This just in:  police are widening
		their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
		prominent psychiatrist and author.
		Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
		been abducted by escaped mental patient,
		James Cole. The two are believed to be
		traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
		license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.

	RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.  She feels so badly for
	him.  She wants to help him.  She says, tenderly...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		This can't go on, James.  You're not
		well.  You're burning with fever.

	COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.

<b>				COLE
</b>		We need gas.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I thought you didn't know how to drive.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I said I was too young to drive.  I
		didn't say I was stupid.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What's the matter with your leg?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas
		station up ahead.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Shot!  Who shot you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It was some kind of...war.  Never mind,
		you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.

<b>	INT.  PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)
</b>
	The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY
	remain in the car.  She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You were going to run out off gas on
		purpose, weren't you?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James --
		It'll go much better for you if you do
		-- but I'm not going to trick you.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(sees the credit card)
		That has your name on it.  Give him cash.

	RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
	the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.

	RAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Where are you going?

	She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience
	Store appended to the Gas Station.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You can come with me.  I have to get
		some things.  Scissors, bandages, some
		alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look
		at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor.

	COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She's in charge...for the moment.

<b>	EXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)
</b>
	The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR
	RADIO but not the engine.

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
		Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
		engineers continue their desperate
		attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
		ant in which nine year old...

	COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
	Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  He's staring up
	at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You shouldn't put your weight on it.
		You need stitches and antibiotics.
		Lucky for you it was near the surface.

	RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
	while COLE continues staring up at the sky.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I love seeing the sun.

	A beat.  COLE tries to stand up.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Wait -- let me help you.

	RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat.
	They're very close.  They don't move.  RAILLY looks like she can
	barely breathe.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(leans closer, shuts his eyes)
		You smell so good.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(trying to concentrate)
		You have to give yourself up, you know.

	A beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then
	turns back to her, suddenly grim.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I have to do something now.  Something
		I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry.

	RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He's
	cold now, steeled.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I have a mission.  It's important.

	RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.

<b>	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
	cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering
	another AGENT, he pauses.

<b>				FIRST AGENT
</b>		They find him?

<b>				SECOND AGENT
</b>		Who??

<b>				FIRST AGENT
</b>		That kid.  The one in the pipe.

<b>				SECOND AGENT
</b>		You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey
		down there with a miniature infra-red camera
		strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
		wrapped in tinfoil.

<b>				FIRST AGENT
</b>		You're making that up!

	ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
	the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.

				SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
		I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
		A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who
		thought that one up.

				FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
		Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
		Prize!

	Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn't
	see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.

<b>	INT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM
	MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		Would that I could enjoy this opulent
		dinner and this excellent and
		stimulating company for itself, with no
		sense of purpose.  But alas, I am
		"burdened" with the sense that with all
		this excess of public attention and
		this cacophony of praise, there comes
		great responsibility.  Indeed, I
		practically feel a soapbox growing
		under my feet whenever I stand for more
		than a few seconds.

	While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE
	AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.

				DR. MASON (o.s.)
		The dangers of science are a time worn
		threat, from Prometheus stealing fire
		from the Gods to the Cold War era of
		the Dr. Strangelove Terror.

	AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  JEFFREY MASON!

				DR. MASON (cont.)
		But never before, not even at Los Alamos
		when the scientists made bets on whether
		their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
		New Mexico, has science given us so much
		reason to fear the power we have at hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		What are you talking about?  What
		friend?  I'm not expecting anyone.

	ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		Current genetic engineering as well as
		my own work with viruses has presented
		us with powers as terrifying as any...

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,
	grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		This is ridiculous.  My father is
		making a major address.

<b>	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
</b>
	The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>		Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
		around like this with no I.D., we'd
		bust his ass, excuse the French, but
		this one said he knows you...
			(smirk, smirk)
		-- and, since you seem to have had
		some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates",
		we certainly didn't want to arrest one
		of your, uh, closest...pals.

<b>	INT.  LIBRARY/MASON MANSION
</b>
	COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in
	a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the
	room.  A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(dismissing Cole casually)
		Never saw him before in my life.  Go
		ahead and shoot him or torture him or
		whatever it is you do.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(rising)
		You do know me.  You helped me once.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(turning to leave)
		That would be totally out of character.
		Helping people is against my principles.
			(to the Agents)
		See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now,
		I'm going to go back and listen to my
		father's very eloquent discourse on the
		perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
<b>		INTRUDER TO DEATH.
</b>
<b>				COLE
</b>		I'm here about some monkeys.

	Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes.  A beat.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Excuse me -- what did you say?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Monkeys.  Twelve of them.

	JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE.  Then, suddenly, JEFFREY
	rushes to COLE and embraces him.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Arnold...Arnold.

	COLE is astonished.  The AGENTS are, too.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(stepping back)
		My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
		You look like shit

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>			(dubious)
		You know this man?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Of course I know him.  What do you
		think -- I act like this to strangers?
		Listen -- you fellas are terrific.  I
		thought you were pulling a number on
		me.  What a terrible thing if you'd
		thrown old Arnie out.  I owe you guys
		the big apologia!  Mea culpa, fellas.
			(turning to Cole)
		Christ, Arnie, it's black tie!  I mean,
		I said, "drop by," but, like, this is
		Dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret
		service, and...and everything.

	JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading
	him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.

<b>				AGENT #4
</b>		"Arnie?"

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Arnold Pettibone.  Old Arnie Pettibone.
		Used to be my best friend.  Still is.
		What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?
		No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?
		Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.
		Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.

	The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.

<b>				AGENT #4
</b>		These people -- all of 'em -- are true
		weirdoes!

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>			(moving to the phone)
		I'm gonna call in a description of this
		"Pettibone" character.  You go keep an
		eye on him.  Make sure he doesn't do
		one of the guests with a fork.

<b>	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
</b>
	GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY
	and a very disconcerted COLE.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Hey, nice ta see ya.  Lookin' good!  Hi,
		there.  Yes, it has been a long time.

	In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and
	COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(whispers to Cole)
		County Hospital, right?  1989.  The
		"Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?
			(smiling to guests)
		Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Listen to me -- I can't do anything
		about what you're going to do. I can't
		change anything.  I can't stop you.  I
		just want some information...

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.
			(to a guest)
		I am a new person!  I'm completely
		adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.
			(whispers to Cole)
		Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I just need to have access to the pure
		virus, that's all!  For the future!

	JEFFREY studies COLE.  COLE doesn't just talk crazy.  He looks crazy!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Come on, follow me.  You don't lock so good.

	JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing
	back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I don't have time to go upstairs.  The
		police are looking for me.  I need to
		know where it is and exactly what it is.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(brightening suddenly)
		I get it!  This is your old plan, right?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Plan?  What are you talking about?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Remember?  We were in the dayroom,
		watching TV, and you were all upset
		about the...desecration of the planet.
		And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be
		great if there was a germ or a virus
		that could wipe out mankind and leave
		the plants and animals just as they
		are?"  You do remember that, don't you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		And that's when I told you my father was
		this famous virologist and you said, "Hey,
		he could make a germ and we could steal it!"

<b>				COLE
</b>			(grabbing Jeffrey)
		Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates
		We live underground!  The world belongs
		to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're
		like moles or worms.  All we want to do
		is study the original...

<b>				AGENT #4'S VOICE
</b>		Okay -- take it easy.  We know who you
		are, Mr. Cole.

	COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4

<b>				AGENT #4
</b>		Let's go somewhere and talk this thing
		over. Okay? Just come with me...

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You're right!  Absolutely right.  Me's
		a nut case, totally deranged.  Delusional!
		Paranoid.  HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
<b>		UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.
</b>
	AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD
	AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.

	COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase
	now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE
</b><b>		TWELVE MONKEYS"?  IT'S A COLLECTION OF
</b><b>		NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.
</b><b>		SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN
</b><b>		FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
</b><b>		THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE
</b><b>		RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF
</b><b>		INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR
</b><b>		GRAND PLOT!
</b>
	COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the
	stairs.  It sounds true!  JEFFREY'S so confident.

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>		Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.
		Everything's...

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT
</b><b>		THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH
</b><b>		VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE
</b><b>		"PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH
</b><b>		YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND
</b><b>		LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE
</b><b>		"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES
</b><b>		SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY
</b><b>		CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU
</b><b>		KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???
</b>
	Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,
	shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.

<b>	INT.  FOYER/MASON MANSION
</b>
	COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there!  COLE
	turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way
	through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.

<b>	INT.  DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION
</b>
	SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS
	burst into the room.

<b>				AGENT #4
</b>		Did a man just come through here...limping?

<b>	INT.  KITCHEN/MASON MANSION
</b>
	COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen
	and look about urgently.

<b>	INT.  DEN/MASON MANSION
</b>
	A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in
	front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		These pictures we are seeing are coming
		to us live from deep inside the pipe.
		You can just make out the metal wall
		behind those roots and I guess those
		must be spider webs.

	MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...

				MRS. McCANN
		Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey
		is going to eat the sandwich himself.

	Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.

	The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but
	the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.

	AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS.

	ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		This just in:  Police say that the body of
		a woman found strangled in the Knutson state
		Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.

	As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned
	Acura comes up on the TV screen.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		Earlier in the day, police located
		Railly's abandoned car not far from a

		activists were found bound and gagged...

<b>	EXT.  MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

				AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
<b>		COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
</b><b>		TO HURT YOU.
</b>
<b>	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
</b>
	COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat,
	spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head
	slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.

<b>	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION
</b>
	AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.

<b>	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
</b>
	COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the
	shift into "Drive", then turns the key.  Nothing happens.

	Panic.  COLE studies the shift again.

<b>	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MANSION
</b>
	AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.

<b>	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
</b>
	COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral).  He twists
	the key again.  The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!

<b>	EXT.  LAWN/MANSION
</b>
	AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.

	SMASH.  The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
	accelerates right at him!

	AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
	him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
	two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.

<b>	INT.  MOVING JAGUAR
</b>
	Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.

	The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...

	COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  Steering madly,
	he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.

<b>	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
	Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.

	AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
	its rotors whipping around.

<b>	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT
</b>
	COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the
	other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		LIGHTS!  LIGHTS!
</b>
	He starts hitting switches.  The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		---when they pulled the monkey out, it
		was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped
		sandwich.

	Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.

	COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.

	Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.

<b>	INT.  FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT
</b>
	The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a
	spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.

	Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		There!  He's showing lights.

<b>	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT
</b>
	COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield
	wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		We don't know what to think.  They
		didn't locate him and they don't know
		how much longer he can last, that's
		assuming the boy is still alive.

	A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the
	HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!

<b>	EXT.  OUTERBRIDGE ROAD
</b>
	The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.

<b>	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR
</b>
	COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above
	his front windshield.

	Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  dense woods ahead.

<b>	EXT.  HELICOPTER/WOODS
</b>
	The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.

<b>	INT.  HELICOPTER
</b>
	The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the
	forest below with his spotlight.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		Goddamnit!  Where is he?

	The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.

<b>				CO-PILOT
</b>		There!  Over there.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		Where?
<b>				CO-PILOT
</b>		Eight o'clock!  He was right there.

	The headlights are gone.  Nothing but darkness below.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		He musta turned his lights of if.

<b>				CO-PILOT
</b>		Couldn't drive down there without
		lights.  We just can't see 'em.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		Maybe he's not driving!

<b>	EXT.  WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)
</b>
	A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
	crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.

	A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
	OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.

	The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
	Jaguar.  He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
<b> 
</b><b>				POLICE OFFICER
</b>		He's not in here.

<b>	EXT.  WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT
</b>
	Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
	underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.

	Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.

	The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
	beside the stream.  The car looks empty.

<b>	INT.  TRUNK/FORD
</b>
	Total blackness!  The sound of keys in the lock.

	Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,
	looking down

	RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You bastard!  You total bastard!

<b>	EXT.  FORD
</b>
	COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.

	He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I could have died in there.  If something
		had happened to you I would have died.

	COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I...I...I'm really sorry.

	Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(getting to his feet)
		No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car
		and they chased me.  I hit a tree.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		See -- you can drive after all!

<b>				COLE
</b>		Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry
		I locked you up.  I thought...I thought...
		I think maybe I am crazy!

	She looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What made you think that?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
		the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't
		sure.  We talked when I was in the
		institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
		The drugs and stuff.
			(horrified)
		You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
		out the human race?  It was my idea?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Nobody is going to wipe out the human
		race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
		else.  You've created something in your
		mind, James -- a substitute reality.
		In order to avoid something you don't
		want to face.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would
		love to believe that.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It can be dealt with, but only if you
		want to.  I can help you.

	COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I need help all right.  They're coming
		after me.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		First, it's important that you
		surrender to them instead of them
		catching you running.  Okay?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(brightening)
		It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm
		wrong about everything...the world will be
		okay.  I'll never have to live underground.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Give me the gun.

<b>				COLE
</b>		The gun! ... I lost it

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You're sure?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(showing her)
		No gun!
			(looking up)
		Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!

	RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I'm going to attract their attention,
		let them know where we are, okay?

	RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(calling out)
		They'll tell you to put your hands on top
		of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're
		going to get better, James -- I know it!

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He
	reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
	stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The
	HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.

	ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.

	ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I love this world!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
	from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the
	car, starts around toward COLE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll
		stay with you.  I won't let them...

	She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!

	COLE is gone.  Disappeared.

<b>	INT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
	RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Then I said something to him about
		cooperating and he said he would do
		that, so I got in the car and started
		honking the horn.  When I got out, he
		was gone.

<b>				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
</b>		You lucked out.  For a while we thought
		you were a body they found down state...
		mutilated.

	A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		He wouldn't do something like that -- he...

<b>				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
</b>			(interrupts, hands her the photo)
		This the man he attacked?

	RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped
	against the alley wall, obviously dead.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I'd like to be clear about this.  That
		man and the other one were..."severely"
		beating us.  James Cole didn't start
		it.  In fact -- he saved me!

<b>				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
</b>		Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can
		explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist
		-- why do kidnap victims almost always
		try to tell us about the guys who grabbed
		'em and try to make us understand how
		kind these bastards really were?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(as if reciting)
		It's a normal reaction to a life-
		threatening situation.
			(suddenly animated)
		He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the
		future.  He's been living in a carefully
		constructed fantasy world and that world
		is starting to disintegrate.  He needs
		help!

<b>	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM
</b>
	YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.

	He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he
	sprawls on the concourse...

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Wake up! Wake up!

<b>				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		I think we gave him too much.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b><b>		WAKE UP, PRISONER!
</b>
<b>	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	COLE blinks awake. All he can see are blurry faces hovering over
	him, hammering him with questions.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Come on, Cole, cooperate!

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		Spit it out... you went to the home of
		a famous virologist...

<b>				COLE
</b>			(weakly)
		You...don't...exist!  You're in
		my mind...

<b>				SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)
</b>		What?  What's that?  What did he say?  His
		brain's fried.  Give him another shot!
<b>		SPEAK UP, COLE.  WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?
</b>
<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - EVENING
</b>
	The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but
		apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal
		as she left the police station in
		Philadelphia this morning.  So far she
		has refused to make a public statement.

	RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.

	A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her
	bedroom.  She still looks exhausted   Followed by her cat, she
	enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily
	turns down the TV.

<b>				WAYNE
</b>		Sorry.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		No -- I'm in a state of hyper-
		alertness.  I can't sleep.

<b>				MARILOU
</b>		Did you take the sedative?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I hate those things.  They mess my head
		up.

	The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes
	the volume up.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore
		woman, James Cole is now also wanted in
		connection with the brutal slaying of
		Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...

	RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...

	HER POV:  ACROSS THE STREET...A COP keeps watch.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
		Do they really expect him to come here?

	RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the
	tea things out.

				TV REPORTER on air
		And in Fresno, California...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(glances sadly toward the TV)
		He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?

<b>				WAYNE
</b>		He's fine.  It was just a "prank" he
		and his friends pulled.

<b>	CLOSE ON RAILLY'S FACE... SHOCKED.
</b>
	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year
	old boy being led out of a barn by the police.  The cops look grim.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Authorities have so far been noncommittal
		about whether they will try to file
		charges against the families of the
		children involved in the hoax.

	RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.

<b>	INT.  "HOSPITAL" ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	VOICES!  SINGING!  COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then
	stares in disbelief....

	Crowded around COLE'S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a
	ragged, out of tune, rendition of "BLUEBERRY HILL."

<b>				SCIENTISTS
</b>		---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...

	Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.

<b>				SCIENTISTS
</b>		Well done, James!  Well done!  Nice
		going!  Congratulations!  Good for you!

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		During your "interview," while you
		were..."under the influence," you told
		us you liked music!

	COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless
	room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century
	landscapes.

	The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a
	friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		This isn't the prison, James.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		This is a hospital.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		But just until you recover your,
		uh,... equilibrium.

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>		You're still a little... disoriented.

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		Stress!  Time travel!

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		You stood up very well, considering...

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		Superior work!  Superior!

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		You connected the Army of the 12
		Monkeys to a world famous virologist
		and his son...

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		Others will take over now...

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		We'll be back on the surface in a

</b>		We're very close!  Because of you!

<b>				ENGINEER
</b>			(unrolling a document)
		This is it, James...what you've been
		working for.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		A full pardon!

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		You'll be out of here in no time.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Women will want to get to know you...

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU
</b><b>		BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
</b>
	Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break
	through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the
	loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>			(sympathetically)
		Of course you want to be well, James.
		And you will be...soon.

	COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!
</b><b>		YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T

</b>
	CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		He not only used the word "prank" -- he
		said the boy was hiding in a barn.

	RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist
	sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him
		murder someone.  You knew there was a real
		possibility he would kill you, too.  You
		were under tremendous emotional stress.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he
		knew about the boy in Fresno and he says
		three billion people are going to die!

<b>				DR. FLETCHER
</b>		Kathryn, you know he can't possibly
		know that.  You're a rational person.
		You're a trained psychiatrist.  You
		know the difference between what's real
		and what's not.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		And what we believe is what's accepted as
		"truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry --
		it's the latest religion.  And we're the
		priests -- we decide what's right and what's
		wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...
		I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.

<b>	INT. "HOSPITAL" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	Alone in his "hospital" room, COLE struggles without success to
	free himself from his restraints.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You sure fucked up, Bob!

	Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and
	continues his feverish struggle.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		But I can understand you don't want
		your mistakes pointed out to you. I can
		relate to that, old Bob.

	COLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the
	walls and the landscape paintings.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're
		thinking I don't exist except in your
		head.  I can see that point of view.  But
		you could still talk to me, couldn't you?
		Carry on a decent conversation?

<b>				COLE
</b>			(blurting)
		I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world!
		You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
		They don't like that.  That's a no-no.
		And when did you say you saw me?
		In...1872?

<b>				COLE
</b><b>		FUCK YOU!
</b>
				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Yelling won't get you what you want.  You
		have to be smart to get what you want.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Oh, yeah?  What do I want?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You don't know what you want?  Sure you
		do, Bob.  You know what you want.

	COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Tell me.  Tell me what I want.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to
		be topside -- breathe the air -- to be
		with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't
		that what you want?

	Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he
	speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.

<b>				COLE
</b>		More...than...anything.

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
	RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the
	bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient
	herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone.

<b>	INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM
</b>
	CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.

</b>		Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..
		Sorry to call so early but...

	CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You found him?  Is he all right?

	CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
	giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop
	across his desk, then continuing into the phone,

<b>				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
</b>		Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your
		good friend, the kidnapper.  However,
		the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic
		report on my desk that says the bullet
		you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's
		thigh is an antique...and all indications
		are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.

	ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,

<b>				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
</b>		So what I was thinking was, maybe if I
		sent a detective down there to talk
		with you, you could maybe revise or
		amplify on the circumstances....
		Hello?  Hello?  Dr. Railly?

	HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM/STUDY
</b>
	Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked.  Then, she
	hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
	arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
	finds a copy of her book.  She leafs through it hurriedly,
	locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.

	Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
	Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
	photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		No!

	It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in
	the trenches.  And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas
	mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it's COLE!!!

<b>	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

		become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To
		that "dying" world'

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, sir!  I just want to do my part.
		To get us back on top...in charge of
		the planet.  And I have the experience,
		I know who the people are...

<b>				BIOLOGIST
</b>		He really is the most qualified...

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		But all that..."behavior"...

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>			(to Cole, a little hurt)
		You said we weren't "real," Cole...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Well, sir, I don't think the human mind
		was built to exist in two different...
		whatever you call it..."dimensions."
		It's stressful, you said it yourselves,
		it gets you confused.  You don't know
		what's real and what's not.

<b>				MICROBIOLOGIST
</b>		But you know what's real now?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Yes, sir.

	The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves

<b>				GEOLOGIST
</b>		He'd have to bone up, catch up to our
		research, the latest clues...

<b>				ZOOLOGIST
</b>		He's proved to be a quick study...

	The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		You can't trick us, you know.  It
		wouldn't work.

<b>				BIOLOGIST
</b>		And why would you want to?  It'll be
		dangerously close to the end.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I understand.  There'd be no point.

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		We're going to think about it, Cole.
		Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.

<b>	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a
	hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white "space suits" work
	methodically, DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone.  His male
	ASSISTANT, whose features we don't see, stops writing a formula
	on a blackboard and listens.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		You have reason to believe that my son
		may be planning to do what?!!!

<b>	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT/STUDY

	RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Please, I know it sounds insane but...

<b>	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE
</b>
	Dr. Mason on the phone.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>			(into the phone)
		I'm afraid this doesn't seem very
		professional to me, in fact it's
		distressingly unprofessional for some-
		one who treated my son briefly (if
		indeed you actually are who you say you
		are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
		in his mental health six years later,
		and to telephone a parent to express
		opinions that would be inappropriate...
			(breaks off, listens, then)
		I don't know anything about "Monkey
		armies", Doctor.  Nothing whatsoever.
		If my son ever was involved in...
			(listens, then,)
		It would be doubly inappropriate to
		discuss matters of security with you,
		Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at
		ease, neither my son nor any other
		unauthorized person has access to any
		potentially dangerous organisms in this
		laboratory.  Thank you for your concern.

	DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by
		that man who broke into my house.  She
		seems to have been suddenly struck by
		the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic
		visions.

	We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now.  It's DR. PETERS, the red-
	haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be
	insane to think the world was coming to an end.

				DR. PETERS (cont.)
		Has she succumbed to her own
		theoretical..."disease"?

	But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		Given the nature of our work, we can't ever

<b>	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
</b>
	COLE is facing the BOTANIST who's using a pointer to indicate
	various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		Let's consider again our current
		information -- if the symptoms were
		first detected in Philadelphia on June
		28, 1995, that makes us know that...?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It was released in Philadelphia,
		probably on June 14, 1995.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		And it appeared sequentially after that
		in...?

	With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him
	from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,

<b>				COLE
</b>		San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de
		Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		Meaning...???

<b>				COLE
</b>		That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
		to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,
		Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		And your only goal is...???

<b>				COLE
</b>		To find out where the virus is so a
		qualified scientist can travel back into
		the past and study the original virus.

<b>				BOTANIST
</b>		So that...???

<b>				COLE
</b>		Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed
		that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim
		the surface of the earth.

	COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
	BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...

	a magazine photo of wall graffiti:  "ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE
<b>	WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?"
</b>
				BOTANIST (o.s.)
		This is from a magazine printed in late
		September, 1995.  The writer speculated
		that this graffiti might be related to
		the epidemic that by that time had
		already killed thirty million people
		world-wide and was getting worse.  He
		says, certain people, unnamed, were
		questioned, but what came of that is not
		known.  But it is a clue you should pursue.

	COLE stares at the picture.

<b>	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY
</b>
	LOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with
	posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with
	electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into
	tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It's RAILLY.

<b>				RAILLY
</b><b>		IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS
</b><b>		SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE,
</b><b>		I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
</b>
<b>	INT.  FAA STORE
</b>
	JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY
	and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons
	as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.

<b>				FALE
</b>		It's the kidnap woman -- the one who
		was with the guy who tied us up.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What's she doing?

<b>				FALE
</b>		She's drawing attention to us, that's
		what she's doing. ... I don't know what
		you're up to this time, Mason, but
		you're gonna get us in deep shit!

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie
		talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies.

<b>	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT
</b>
	From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,
	seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.

<b>				RAILLY
</b><b>		I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I
</b><b>		KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
</b>
				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		Secret experiments!

	RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You!  I know you!

	But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		Not just on them.  Do 'em on people,
		too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em
		chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Have you seen James Cole?  The man...?

<b>				LOUIE
</b>		They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures.

	RAILLY follows his look.

	ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to
		talk to James, but he has to be careful
		how he contacts me.  He mustn't get
		caught.  Do you understand me?

<b>				LOUIS
</b>		Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		He was with me, he spoke to you.
		Several weeks ago.  He said you were
		from the future...watching him.

	LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!"

	But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously
	"tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.

	RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.

<b>	INT.  FAA STORE
</b>
	FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY,
	and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening
	between posters at the front window.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You get the bolt cutters?

<b>				KWESKIN
</b>		One dozen.  They're in the van.

<b>				FALE
</b>		One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you
		gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(grins)
		You really want to know?

<b>				FALE
</b>		No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Hey!  Do you know what she's doing?

	Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside.

	Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.

	POV THROUGH SLIT:  a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front
	of the store!

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		What's it say?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I can't see it.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>			(erupting)
<b>		WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN
</b><b>		PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT
</b><b>		HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
</b>
<b>				FALE
</b>			(spinning around)
		Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say,
		"your psychiatrist"?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about
		flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

<b>				FALE
</b>		That woman is...was...your...
		psychiatrist?  And now she's spray-
		painting our building?

<b>	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE
</b>
	ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,
	amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.  He shakes his head wearily.

	ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with
	amazement, too.  They include...

	an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...

	a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...

	an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...

	the TEENAGED PUNKS...

	a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,
	reacting at the sight of RAILLY.  It's COLE!  He pushes toward her.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Kathryn!

	RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!

	With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes
	urgent charge of the situation.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend
		you don't know me.  If he sees you...

<b>				COLE
</b>			(turning, looking)
		No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?
			(placing his hands on his head)
		Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm
		not crazy any more!  I mean, I am
		crazy, mentally divergent, actually,
		but I know it now and I want you to
		help me.  I want to get well...

	ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
	she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James -- put your hands down and listen
		to me.  Things have changed!

	ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
	his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:  she
	tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
	him along...but COLE isn't moving.  He's staring at the front of
	the FAA Store with disbelief!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, come on!  We have to get out of here!

	COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
	then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:

<b>			ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!
</b><b>			IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE
</b><b>			SOURCE?  THREE BILLION DIE?
</b>
	It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!

<b>				COLE
</b>		I've seen that...before.

	But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, trust me.  We're in terrible
		trouble.  We have to run.

	Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
	ONLOOKERS.  She looks crazier than he does.

	ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
	colliding with a passing car.  BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.

<b>	INT.  FAA STORE - DAY
</b>
	ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her
		and some other guy I can't see.

<b>				FALE
</b>		Hey, no problem, it's probably just
		another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's
		shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
			(indicating Jeffrey to the others)
		This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic
		who told his former psychiatrist all his
		plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
		schemes, and now who knows what she's
		painted out there on our wall?

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
</b><b>		WALLS?
</b>			(moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)
		You think I told her about the Army of
		the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why,
		you pathetically ineffectual and
		pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to-
		animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because
		when I had anything to do with her six
		years ago, there was no such thing -- I
		hadn't even thought of it yet!

<b>				FALE
</b>			(triumphant)
		Then how come she knows what's going on?

	JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a
	supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Here's my theory on that.  While I was
		institutionalized, my brain was studied
		exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
		I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied
		thoroughly.  Then, everything about me
		was entered into a computer where they
		created a model of my mind.

	They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  Is he
	serious?  Is he crazy?  Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		Then, using the computer model, they
		generated every thought I could possibly
		have in the next, say ten years, which
		they then filtered through a probability
		matrix to determine everything I was
		going to do in that period.  So you
		see, she knew I was going to lead the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
		pages of history before it ever even
		occurred to me.  She knows everything
		I'm ever going to do before I know it
		myself.  How about that?

	JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Now I have to get going -- do my part.
		You guys check all this stuff out and
		load up the van.  Make sure you have
		everything.  I'm outta here.

	JEFFREY exits.  The others stare at the door.

<b>				FALE
</b>		He's seriously crazy -- you know that.

<b>	EXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY
</b>
	An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.

	The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP'S eyes searching everywhere.

	Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
	torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.

	HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!  Come on.

	A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
	bits of lettuce in his hair.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I don't understand what we're doing.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAILLY
</b>			(climbing out of the dumpster)
		We're avoiding the police until I
		can....talk to you.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(climbing out after her)
		You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn,
		those words on the wall -- I've seen
		them before...  I...I...dreamed them.

	But she's not listening.  She's peeking out the alley entrance.

	RAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
<b>	THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.
</b>
<b>	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER
</b>
	The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,
	stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.

<b>				DESK CLERK
</b>		Twenty five bucks an hour.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		An hour?!

<b>				DESK CLERK
</b>		You want quarter hours, go someplace else.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(catches on, pulls out her last bills)
		Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal?

	The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he
	turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.

<b>				DESK CLERK
</b>		Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right.
		Elevator's busted.

	RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs
	passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas
	chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.

	ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb
	stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,
	punches a number, speaks into the phone.

<b>				DESK CLERK
</b>		Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe.
		You know if Wallace has a new girl?
		Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde?

<b>	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</b>
	COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY
	pace back and forth like a mad woman.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Okay...you were standing there looking
		at the moon...you were eating grass...
		then what?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I thought I was in...prison again.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Just like that?  You were in prison?

<b>				COLE
</b>		No, not really.  It's...it's in my
		mind.  Like you said.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You disappeared!  One minute you were
		there, the next minute you were gone.
		Did you run through the woods?

<b>				COLE
</b>		I don't know -- I don't remember.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		The boy in the well.  How did you know
		that was just a hoax?

<b>				COLE
</b>		It was?  I didn't...know.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

<b>				COLE
</b>		I think I saw a TV show like that when
		I was a kid.  Where a boy...

<b>				RAILLY
</b><b>		IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
</b>
	COLE looks at her.  She's really upset.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV
		show and copied it.  Listen, you were
		right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally
		ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know
		they're not real, I can trick them, make
		them do what I want.  I just worked on
		them in my head and I got back here.  I
		can get better.  I can stay here.

	RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.

	It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in
	WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What does this mean to you?

<b>				COLE
</b>		...I had a dream about...something
		like that.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You had a bullet from World War One in
		your leg, James!  How did it get there?

<b>				COLE
</b>		You said I had delusions -- that I
		created a world -- you said you could
		explain everything...

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying
		to.  I can't believe that everything we
		do or say has already happened, that we
		can't change what's going to happen,
		that I'm one of the three billion
		people who are going to die...soon.

	COLE stands, moves close to her.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I want to be here.  In this time.  With
		you.  I want to become...become a whole
		person.  I want this to be the present.
		I want the future to be unknown.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(sudden hopeful idea!)
		James...do you remember...six years
		ago...you had a phone number!  You
		tried to call and...

	WHAM!  The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not
	holding.  A menacing figure stands in the doorway.  WALLACE.  A
	wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.

	COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks
	them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		This is my territory, bitch!

<b>				COLE
</b>			(confused, turns to Railly)
		Is this real -- or is this one of my
		delusions?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		This is definitely real:
			(to Wallace)
		Excuse me, I think we have a little
		misunderstanding here...

	WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face.  She flies back against the
	wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
	stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		What're you -- some kind of tough guy?
		You wanna be a hero?  You gonna try and
		mess with me?  Come on...

	A beat.  COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
	WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		Now that's a smart boy.  But you,
		honey, you think you can go 'round
		me and peddle your fancy ass in this
		part of town, you bet your life we got
		what I would call a major goddamn
		misunderstandin'.

	RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs
	her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face
	with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a
	twig!  The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain
	and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves
	the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.

<b>				RAILLY
</b><b>		JAMES -- DON'T!
</b>
	COLE hesitates.

<b>				WALLACE
</b>			(eyes bulging)
		You...heard...her.  Don't do it, man.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(gets up, looks around)
		Put him in the closet, ... But get his
		money first.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(amazed)
		You want me to rob him?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I...I...We need cash, James.

	A shadow.  RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE
	disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...

				SHOUTS (o.s.)
		They're killing him!  Call the cops.

	Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his
	pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		You two are crazy.  I got friends.  You
		put me in a closet, they're gonna be
		really pissed.

	COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to
his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.

	HER POV:  A fire escape leads down into an alley.

	RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the
	bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James, no!

<b>	INT.  BATHROOM
</b>
				RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)
			(rattling the door knob)
		James, what are you doing?

	WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		I have friends, man -- if you cut me...

	WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!

<b>				WALLACE
</b>		What...the...fuck..are you doing???

<b>	INT.  GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44
</b>
	RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it
	opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping
	with blood.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Oh, my God, James.  Did you kill him?

	COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Just...just in case.  In case I'm not
		crazy...
			(holds up two bloody molars)
		That's how they find us.  By our teeth.
			(a beat, eye contact)
		I don't want them to find me.  Ever.  I
		don't want to go back.

	RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
	choice he's made.  Given up the future (if it exists, and it's
	looking like it does)!  Risking his life to be with her!  For
	this brief time!  She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears
	welling in her eyes.  But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and
	feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.

<b>	INT.  STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL

	COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.

<b>	INT.  ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL
</b>
	In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as
	COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Push it tight!

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
<b>		NO PROBLEM!  I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!
</b><b>		DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
</b>
<b>	INT.  4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL
</b>
	POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious
	entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.

	Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into
	their doorways.

<b>	EXT.  GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
</b>
	COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
	They come to the end of the metal stairway.  It's a long distance
	to the ground.  COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.

	She lets herself down to him.  Their eyes meet.  He holds her in
	his arms for a moment.  Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
	They start running down the alley.

<b>	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY
</b>
	The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall
	alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS
	are backing him up, weapons drawn.

<b>				PLAINCLOTHES COP
</b><b>		POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
</b><b>		COME OUTTA THERE!
</b>
	No response.

<b>	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44
</b>
	The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol
	extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room.

	HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor.

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
<b>		HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT
</b><b>		VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A
</b><b>		COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!
</b>
<b>	EXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
	toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks
	furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her
	bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
	handkerchief to his mouth.

	As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
	city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up.

	COLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building
	with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!

	ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
	entrance to a store.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone
		number.  Let's hope it's nothing!

	Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
	her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
	intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
	looming frighteningly close.

	A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
	window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away

	Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
	toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.

	COLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
	the phone.

	ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
	panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares
	at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
	BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
	eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!  James!  It's okay.  We're
		insane!  We're crazy!

	COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...

<b>				COLE
</b>		A Carpet Cleaning Company?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(laughing)
		No superiors!  No scientists.  No
		people from the future.  It's just a
		Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have
		voice mail -- you leave a message
		telling them when you want your carpet
		cleaned.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You... you left them a message?
<b>	
</b><b>				RAILLY
</b>			(impishly)
		I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved.
		Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
		telling them...they better watch out
		for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

	Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
	realizes the truth!  He starts to recite...

<b>				COLE
</b>		"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
		they're the ones who are going to do
		it.  I can't do anything more.  The
		police are watching me."

	Now she's stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth
	twenty yards away.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You... you couldn't have heard me.

<b>				COLE
</b>		They got your message, Kathryn.  They
		played it for me.  It was a bad
		recording...distorted.  I didn't
		recognize your voice.

	RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.

	ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
	CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
	Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
	into the CROWD.

</b>		Come on.

<b>	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM
</b>
	RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds
	a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped
	on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		And this.
			(turning)
		Anything else?

	But COLE'S not here.  He's a short distance away...staring.

	COLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of
	brand new consumer goods.

	ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and
	full of moldering merchandise.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		I guess that's it.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(producing Wallace's roll of bills)
		No -- I'll pay cash.

	The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What floor are the wigs on, please?

<b>	EXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
</b>
	Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
	PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
	street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.

<b>	INT.  PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN
</b>
	The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among
	them, all wearing black.  Some of them have climbing gear, tool
	belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  KWESKIN is telling his story.

<b>				KWESKIN
</b>		So then he goes into this incredible riff
		about how his shrink, like, replicated
		his brain while he was in the nut house.
		Turned it into a computer.

<b>				WELLER
</b>		And Fale believed it?

<b>				KWESKIN
</b>		Oh, you know Fale!  He's like, "If you
		guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --
		I never saw you before in nay life!"

	LAUGHTER from all of them.  Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic
	series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.

	POPE quickly slides the door open.  It's JEFFREY...grinning.

	Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of
	the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.

	The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far
	out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.

	Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Let's do it!

<b>	EXT.  VAN/FREEWAY
</b>
	The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.

<b>	INT.  PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING
</b>
	The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a
	flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Okay, that's Stage One.  In Stage Two,
		Monkey Four is over here...

	A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.

<b>				GOINES
</b>		What's the harm in opening the bag?
		His eyes are taped.

<b>				SANDY
</b>		Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.

<b>				ICHIOKA
</b>		So why should we be like him?

	Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing
	DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		Want the full effect?

	Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		Jeffrey?  I know it's you, Jeffrey.  I
		recognize your voice.

	JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You're out
		of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all
		about your insane plan.  That woman --
		your psychiatrist -- she told me.

	JEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  This he hadn't expected.

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy
		even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps
		to make sure you couldn't do it.  I took myself
		out of the loop!  I don't have the code any
		more.  I don't have access to the virus.  So,
		go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract
		anything of use to yourself.

	The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		What...virus?

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>			(spins his head toward Jeffrey)
		She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew
		you were going to try this.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		What virus are we talking about, Dad?

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		You're insane, Jeffrey.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b>		You "develop" viruses and you're calling
		me insane?  Typical.  What does this
		virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick
		fuck, it doesn't matter.
			(to the others)
		Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I
		put helpless animals in cages and measure
		their reactions to electrical stimuli?
		Do I inject radioactive substances into
		living creatures and examine their
		bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!

<b>				DR. MASON
</b>		Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly
		are you going to do?  I don't have to
		tell you I'm afraid.

<b>				JEFFREY
</b><b>		THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE
</b><b>		OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.
</b><b>		GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
</b><b>		HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED
</b><b>		FUCKING MANIAC?

<b>	INT.  MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
	Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.
	It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE
	(KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a
	redwood tree.  We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.

				SCOTTY (up on the screen)
		Here's a cross section of one of the
		old trees that's been cut down.

	They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
<b>	"BIRTH OF CHRIST", "DISCOVERY OF AMERICA", "MAGNA CARTA SIGNED",
</b>	"1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".

	ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the
	flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.

				MADELINE (up on the screen)
		Somewhere in here I was born.  And here
		-- I die.  There's only a moment for
		you.  You don't notice.

	ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the
	theater.  WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Here, let me help you.

	The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
	screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's
	doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I think I've seen this movie before.
		When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(fussing with his upper lip)
		Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

<b>				COLE
</b>			(moving his head to see the film)
		I have seen it, but I don't remember
		this part.  Funny, it's like what's
		happening to us, like the past.  The
		movie never changes -- it can't change
		-- but everytime you see it, it seems
		to be different because you're different
		-- you notice different things.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		If we can't change anything...because
		it's already happened, then we ought to
		at least smell the flowers.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Flowers!  What flowers?

	From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(whispering)
		It's an expression.  Here...

	She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing
	it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...

<b>				COLE
</b>		Why are we doing this?

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		So we can stick our heads out the
		window and feel the wind and listen to
		the music.  So we can appreciate what
		we have while we have it.  Forgive me,
		psychiatrists don't cry.

	There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE.

<b>				COLE
</b>		But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're
		wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		In a few weeks, it will have started or
		it won't.  If there are still baseball
		games and traffic jams, armed robberies
		and boring TV shows -- we'll be so
		happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves
		in to the police.

<b>				SHADOWY MOVIEGOER
</b><b>		SHHHHHHH    
</b>
<b>				COLE
</b>			(whispers)
		Where can we hide for a few weeks?

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,
	the OCEAN behind them.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		You said you'd never seen the ocean...

<b>	EXT.  GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
</b>
	CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.

	URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL.
	Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
	with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset.

	CLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
	MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.

				DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
		What are you doing to me?  Where are
		we?  Jeffrey, please...

				SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		For God's sake, put the tape back on
		his mouth!

	The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than
		he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?

<b>	EXT.  PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
</b>
	Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
	forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.

<b>	EXT.  LION'S PEN/ZOO
</b>
	The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness,
	unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.

<b>	EXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO
</b>
	A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
	metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
	CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
	EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.

<b>	INT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM
</b>
	CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS
	continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie
	filling his field of vision.

	HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by
	screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on
	both sides of him.  He's alone.  He panics.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Kathryn?!

<b>	INT.  THEATER LOBBY
</b>
	A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock
	Festival".  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead
	to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a
	tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she
	reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
	She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward
	the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate
	in the tight dress.

	Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a
	Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this
	man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN
	stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.

<b>				BRUNETTE
</b>		We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.

	The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,
	revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is
	COLE!  He's confused.

<b>				COLE
</b>		You were in my dream just now.  I
		didn't recognize you.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Well, you look pretty different, too.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize
		it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I
		thought you were gone.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(studies him seriously)
		I remember you...like this.  I feel
		I've known you before.  I feel I've
		always known you.

	Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him
	with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,
	unmarked door, then closing it behind them.

<b>	INT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER
</b>
	RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She
	kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other
	janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move
	deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
	Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled
	theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.

<b>	EXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN
</b>
	The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
	silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
	The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
	across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
	reality.  Did we really see him at all?

<b>	EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
</b>
	The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
	building, deserted in the early morning light.  High up, a MONKEY
	his head around a girder.

	Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.

<b>	EXT.  SHOPPING MALL - DAWN
</b>
	Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
	across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.

	Nothing happens.  For a long moment.  Then, an AFRICAN BULL
	ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
	the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
	other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.

<b>	INT.  TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING
</b>
	A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is
	at the wheel of the cab.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		What time's your flight, friends?

	In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to
	his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Nine thirty

<b>				WOMAN CABBIE
</b>		Might be tight.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(startled, checks her watch)
		Tight?  My watch says 7:30.

<b>				WOMAN CABBIE
</b>		On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a
		time, but today, gotta take inta account
		your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		What?  What did you say?

<b>				WOMAN CABBIE
</b>		Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks
		didn't turn on your radio this morning.

	COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.

<b>				WOMAN CABBIE
</b>		Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta
		the zoo last night.  Then they locked up
		this big shot scientist in one of the cages.
		Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!

	RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		Now they got animals all over the
		place.  Buncha zebras shut down the
		thruway 'bout an hour ago and some
		kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got
		traffic blocked for miles over on 22.

	Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		That's what they were up to!  Freeing
		animals!

<b>				COLE
</b>		On the walls -- they meant the animals
		when they said, "We did it."

<b>				WOMAN CABBIE
</b>		You can hear it on the radio all the
		stations...

	As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE
	follows her look.

	COLE'S POV:  two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the
	cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		In the meantime, numerous animal rights
		activists have joined the chorus
		condemning what they're calling the
		"loose canon" activities of Jeffrey
		Mason and his Army of the Twelve
		Monkeys.
				RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)
		Can these fools seriously believe that
		releasing a captive animal into an
		urban environment is being compassionate
		to the animal?  It's mindlessly cruel,
		almost as indefensible as holding the
		animal in captivity in the first place.

	RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a
	backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Maybe it's going to be okay.

<b>	INT.  TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING

	while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..

	REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR
	at one end of the ticket counter.

<b>				DETECTIVE
</b>		Tell your people if they spot either
		one of them, not to try and apprehend
		then.  They should notify us and...

	ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.

<b>				P.A. SYSTEM
</b>		-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
		for boarding at Gate Seventeen.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the
	bustling airport lobby.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I know this place! ... This is my dream.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Airports all look the same.  Maybe
		it's...
			(turning, reacting)
		James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.

	But COLE isn't listening.  He's looking around, mesmerized.

<b>				COLE
</b>		It's not just my dream.  I was actually
		here!  I remember now.  My parents
		brought me to meet my uncle.  About a
		week or two before...before...before
		everybody started dying.

	RAILLY glances around nervously.

	RAILLY'S POV:  two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the
	lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		They may be looking for us, James.
			(placing the tube in his hand)
		Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
<b>  
</b><b>				COLE
</b>			(confounded)
		I was here...as a kid.  I think you
		were here, too.  But you...looked just
		like you look now.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(getting desperate)
		James, if we're identified, they're
		going to send us someplace...but not to
		Key West!

<b>				COLE
</b>			(snaps out of it, hand to moustache)
		Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>			(indicating a sign)
		I'll get the tickets and meet you... in
		the Gift Shop.

	COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as
	RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip
	clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring
	glances.

<b>	INT.  TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY

	BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as
	COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.

	Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  Coming
	to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.

	CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,
	hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT
	who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  The GENTLEMAN
	walks away.

	nothing like the Railly on the flyer.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for
		Key West.

<b>	INT.  PAY PHONES/TERMINAL
</b>
	COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.

<b>				COLE
</b>		Listen, I don't know whether you're
		there or not.  Maybe you just clean
		carpets.  If you do, you're lucky --
		you're gonna live a long, happy life.
		But if you other guys exist and you're
		picking this up -- forget about the
		Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they
		didn't do it.  It was a mistake'
		Someone else did it.  The Army of The
		Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids
		playing revolutionaries.  It was
		someone else!

	COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next
	phone looking away quickly.  COLE touches his loose moustache as
	he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I've done my job.  I did what you wanted.
		Good luck.  I'm not coming back!

	COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
	Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.

<b>	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY
</b>
	The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.

<b>				TICKET AGENT
</b>		Don't see a lot of this... cash.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		It's...a long story.

<b>				TICKET AGENT
</b>			(smiles, hands over the tickets)
		They'll begin boarding in about twenty
		minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.

	Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put
	them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  As she kneels
	to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from
	the waist down.  WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag
	resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
	we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!

<b>	INT.  MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing
	and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying
	his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.

	Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's
	Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some
	goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
	against his face as he leans close to the mirror.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Got yourself a prob, Bob?

	COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  Nothing!  Until
	he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
	occupied stall.  It must be him!

<b>				COLE
</b>		Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I
		didn't have to do that.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Point of fact -- you don't belong here.
		It's not permitted to let you stay.

	A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall.  COLE'S answer is loud
	and defiant.

<b>				COLE
</b>		This is the present.  This is not the past.
		This is not the future.  This is right now!

	A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE
	a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I'm staying here! You got that?  You
		can't stop me!

<b>				PLUMP MAN
</b>			(high pitched voice)
		Anything you say, chief.  It's none of
		my business.

	COLE looks dismayed.  This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"!  And there
	are no feet showing under the other stalls.  Did he imagine it?

<b>	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY

<b>	INT.  TERMINAL LOBBY
</b>
	COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid.  He glances
	around nervously.  Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking
	toward the Gift Shop.  Before he gets more than a few steps,
	someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.

				FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)
		You gotta be crazy, man!

	COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.
	Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses

<b>				COLE
</b>		Jo...Jose????

<b>				JOSE
</b>		Pulling out the tooth, man, that was
		nuts!  Here, take this.

	JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  Astonished, COLE resists!

<b>				COLE
</b>		What?  What for?  Are you crazy?

	Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.

<b>				JOSE
</b>		Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one!
		You were a hero, man.  They gave you a
		pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come
		back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!

<b>	INT.  GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY

	RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,
	includes it with several magazines she's holding.  She doesn't
	notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!

	The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and
	frowns.  It's getting late and where's Cole?  She turns, heads
	for the cash register to make her purchases.

	MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
	He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.

	The paper features a banner headline..."ANIMALS SET FREE" and a
	sub head..."PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE"
	over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and
	another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.

	Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch
	again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY
	looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.

	Startled, RAILLY frowns.  Does she know this man?

	MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the
	shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.

	RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do!  He's DR. MASON'S
	ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!

	Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.

	Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the
	CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops
	a bundle of newspapers at her feet.

	RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened
	GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS
	CREATE CHAOS".  Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the
	gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.

	CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab.  There's someone else
	in the picture.  It's a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!

<b>	MEMORY FLASHBACK!  INT.  RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
</b>
	RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little"
		represents the sane vision and that
		Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!"
		is the cry of the true lunatic?

<b>	INT.  GIFT SHOP - DAY
</b>
	RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Oh, my God!

<b>				P.A  SYSTEM
</b>		-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at Gate 36.

<b>	INT.  LOBBY - DAY
</b>
	In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions,
	COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.

<b>				JOSE
</b>		Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.
			(then, blurting it out)
		Look, I got orders, man!  You know what
		I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?
		I'm sposed to shoot the lady!  You got
		that?  They said, "If Cole don't obey
		this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his
		girlfriend!"

	COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.

<b>				JOSE
</b>		I got no choice, man.  These are my
		orders.  Just take it, okay?

	COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now.  They've got him.

<b>				COLE
</b>		This part isn't about the virus, is it?

<b>				JOSE
</b>		Hey, man...

<b>				COLE
</b>		It's about obeying, about doing what
		you're told.

<b>				JOSE
</b>		They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya
		want?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Who am I supposed to shoot?

	Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		James!  Thank God!  I thought you'd
		disappeared.  Listen, I think I know
		who it is!  I saw him!  It's Dr. Mason's
		assistant.  An apocalypse nut!  The next
		flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.
		If he's there, it has to be him.

	JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY
	grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I love you, Kathryn.  Remember that.

	She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Maybe we can stop him.  Maybe we can
		actually do something.

<b>	INT.  SECURITY CHECK POINT/TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
	A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.
	YOUNG COLE!  Exactly as he appears in the dream!

	He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests
	down, and they continue along the concourse.  WE LINGER and
	DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through
	the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine,
	comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.

	ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.

	ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving
	along the conveyer belt.  The bag contains some strange objects.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		Excuse me, sir.  Would you mind letting me
		have a look at the contents of your bag?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples.
		I have the appropriate papers.

<b>	INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT
</b>
	RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of
	TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.

<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Oh, God, we don't have time for this.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his
	Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of
	clothes and a Walkman.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Biological samples.  I have the
		paperwork right here.

	DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY
	OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		I'm going to have to ask you to open
		this, sir.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Open it?
			(blinks stupidly, then)
		Of course.

	DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.

	There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no
	attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.

	SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
<b>	SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.
</b>
	ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the
	commotion.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed
	glass tube out of the metal cylinder.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the
		papers -- it's all proper.  I have a
		permit.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		It's empty!

	Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
		But I assure you, it's not.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
<b>	SECURITY OFFICER.
</b>
<b>				RAILLY
</b>		Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!

<b>				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		You'll have to get in line, ma'am.

<b>				TRAVELER
</b>		We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so
		special about you?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other
	metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye.

	A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,
	and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		It doesn't even have an odor.

	The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,
	and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		That's not necessary, sir.  Here you
		go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have
		a good flight.

	Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and
	shoves them back into his gym bag.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her
	with his finger.

<b>				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		Who are you calling a "moron"?

<b>				COLE
</b>		Get your hands off her!

	The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get
	involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.

	FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE
	senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look.
	For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.

				SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.}
<b>		HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT.
</b>
	DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.

	The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from
	the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS.

	DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants.

	ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he
	confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.

<b>				COLE
</b>		I said, get your hands off her.  She's
		not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a
		psychiatrist.

	RAILLY looks alarmed at that.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE
	has the photos in his hand.

	ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting
	hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.

	ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!

<b>				RAILLY
</b><b>		THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY
</b><b>		VIRUS!  STOP HIM!
</b>
	ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE
<b>	MAN FROM HIS DREAM!
</b>
	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
<b>		PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!
</b>
	ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.

<b>				FIRST DETECTIVE
</b>			(raising his badge)
		Police Officers.  Would you step over
		here, please.

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!

	COLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"!  He gives
	COLE a cold look.

	A beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off
	balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.

	The ALARM goes off!!!!

	The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks
	him aside like a rag doll.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.

	ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.

<b>	ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.
</b>
<b>				FIRST SECURITY OFFICER
</b><b>		HE'S GOT A GUN!
</b>
	ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.

<b>				FIRST DETECTIVE
</b><b>			STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!
</b><b>	
</b>	ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward
	DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a
	plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.

<b>	IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE
</b><b>	SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH "NEW" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF
</b>	YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS
	hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by
	pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b><b>		WATCH IT!
</b>
	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his
	moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear
	shot in the crowded passageway.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings,
	high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...

<b>				BRUNETTE (RAILLY)
</b><b>		N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!
</b>
	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK!

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		My God!  They shot that man!

	Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE
	MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up
	and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
<b>	(WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT,
</b><b>	UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.)
</b>
	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see
	emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the
	BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come along, son, this is no place for us.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder,
	steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging
	helplessly.  It's too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead.

	YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears,
	suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for
	something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.
	Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS
	(whose faces remain out of view).  He can't help sneaking another
	look back.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting
	RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.

	Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's
	found what she's looking for!

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded
	concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Hurry up, son.

	With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG
	COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...
	CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS,
<b>	BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING,
</b><b>	BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER!
</b>
				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.

<b>	INT.  747 CABIN - DAY
</b>
	DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack
	containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to
	him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...

				FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		It's obscene, all the violence, all the
		lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now.
		You might say...we're the next endangered
		species...human beings!

	CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.

<b>				DR. PETERS
</b>		I think you're right. sir.  I think
		you've hit the nail on the head.

	DR. PETERS' POV:  the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman
	in a business suit, offering his hand congenially.  DR. PETERS
	doesn't know who this man is, but we do.  It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!

<b>				ASTROPHYSICIST
</b>		Jones is my name.  I'm in insurance.

<b>	EXT.   PARKING LOT/AIRPORT
</b>
	As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher
	YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks
	back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.

<b>                              CARD: 1841
</b>
<b>                               FADE IN:
</b>
                         

<b>          1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1
</b>

<b>           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-
</b>           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

<b>           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
</b>
           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
           end piece, but it is quite nice.

           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.

           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:

                         


<b>           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
           that for the most part they are people of means.

           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
<b>           REEL.
</b>
           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
           having cut directly from the tune he was previously
           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
           way seems possessed with empty servitude.

           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
           that despite their respective races there is much
           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

                         


<b>           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         3 CONTINUED: 3
</b>           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
           preparing to pose for a portrait.
           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

                         


<b>           EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
           and groves of Saratoga.

           The streets are well populated this morning with many
           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
           well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.

           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
           Solomon to help her across.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Solomon...
           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
           waving her forward:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Come, Anne. Jump.

           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

<b>                          ALONZO MARGARET
</b>           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
           it.

                         

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I will not ruin my dress. Catch
           me!

           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
           replies.

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I will catch you, Anne.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I will.
           Again, lightly stern:

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           You will.

           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
           the delighted applause of the children. That done,
           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.

           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
           this most handsome and harmonious group should be
           obvious.

           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
           Suddenly a voice barks out-

<b>           A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Jasper! Come on!

                         

<b>           INT. STORE - LATER
</b>
           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Mr. Parker.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
           about the store looking for items to purchase.

                         

<b>                          CONTINUED:
</b>

           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests

<b>                          TO SOLOMON:
</b>
<b>                          PARKER (CONT'D)
</b>           A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk
           by way of the French.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           We are in need of a fresh carry
           all for the Mrs's travels.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           A year's passed? Off to Sandy
           Hill?

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I am.
           Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
           from an upper shelf.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Something to suit your style, but
           sturdy enough for the forty miles
           round trip.
           Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           It's beautiful.

<b>                          SOLOMON

           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
           him, slightly effeminate.

<b>           -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841-
</b>           We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the
           purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As
           Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a
           decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT

           After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon,
           Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown
           drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon
           remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
           being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
           money was collected.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Not an additional tip from a one
           of them. They expect to be
           entertained for nothing.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           And not satisfied a bit despite
           giving them more than what they
           paid for.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           It's the national mood. There's
           too much grief to make room for
           frivolity.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
           You were promised opportunity, and
           you were given none.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           The opportunity is with the
           circus. A two man show poorly
           promoted, what were we to expect?
           But the circus bills itself.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           True.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           I have told you of the circus with
           which we are connected. Creatures
           from the darkest of Africa.
           Acrobats from the Orient who--

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           You have described it, yes.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Yes. We need to return
           immediately to Washington.
           Solomon...I believe us familiar
           enough now, but forgive me if I am
           bold...would you consider making
           the trip with us?
           Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.

</b>           And more importantly you would
           build your own name and following.
           The circus tends to attract those
           with the highest of reputations.
           An introduction here and there
           could amount to a lifetime of

</b>           Said as fellow artists as well as
           businessmen. Well worth the
           effort at least.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           You present a flattering
           representation. As my family will
           be traveling back shortly, perhaps
           I might commit only to one trial
           engagement.

           cannot recall being so excited.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           There is a practical concern. If
           you are to continue on with us you
           should obtain your free papers.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Not necessary.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Here in New York, no. But we will
           be entering slave states and as a
           matter of precaution... It's to
           all our benefit we should not have
           to come to account for your well
           being.

<b>                          HAMILTON

           The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace
           is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for
           the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,
           and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands
           are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag
           hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of
           Harrison at varying locations.

           A decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled
           joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are
           among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As
           with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
           accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN
           COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the
           amount.

</b>           Forty-three dollars. All to you.

           amount to.

<b>                          BROWN

<b>                          HAMILTON

           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
           speaks sweetly.

<b>                          HAMILTON

           as well and refreshed as though
           the earth were new again.
           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of

           Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks
           away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than

</b>           Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
           circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
           state he remains.

           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

<b>                          ASKS:

           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:

<b>                          SOLOMON

           man; a resident of Saratoga, New

           free. I have papers. You have no

</b>           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah no free man. And yah ain't
           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
           yielding. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
           but a Georgia runaway.
           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

<b>           DISTINGUISH.
</b>           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
           "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
           extremity of each. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
           nothing of the kind.
           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
           down in a bent position.
           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

<b>           BRUISES.
</b>           This beating continues on and on and on until quite
           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
           Dripping in sweat and panting:

</b>           ...I...I insist...
           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          BURCH

           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
           arm tires before Solomon "breaks."

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Are yah slave?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...No...
           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...

<b>           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
</b>           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
           wrought with poor sincerity::

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           I seen a good many of the black
           kind just where yah're. Sick.
           Make me sick. Often times the
           situation was resolved, and I
           think; what was all the beatin'
           and abuse for? Things end as they
           should, and the violence was for
           naught. So why cause trouble when
           they ain't no cause for it? Be of
           a cooperative nature, and things
           don't need be particularly
           unpleasant.

           been, and I fear yah won't live to
           see Sunday next.
           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to
           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling

           loosens none. Solomon calls out:

</b>           Help me! Someone help me!
           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon
           continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

           Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE
           HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's
           captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and
           cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's
           procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.

<b>          30 EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30
</b>
           It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in
           by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.
           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in
           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
           answers to the name of Randall.
           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are
           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is
           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           Go on. Warsh up.
           The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to
           scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           The boy, too. Get him clean.
           Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           Scrub now. Git 'em clean.
           Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and
           uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.

<b>                          RANDALL
</b>           Do you know when my Mama will
           come?

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           Hush him up!
           Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to
           cry.

<b>                          RANDALL
</b>           Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to
           come?
           Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Quiet, please.
           Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.

<b>                          RANDALL
</b>           Mama!

           Saying anything to keep the boy quiet:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Your mother will come, I swear she
           will, but you must be silent.
           Please. Be silent!
           On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall
           goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws
           water on the soapy men.

           Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of
           meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain
           Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           That old thing of yours is just
           rags and tatters. Need something
           proper to wear.
           Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           Go'won. Put it on.
           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He
           removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was
           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
           Despite that, Radburn says:

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.
           Got no gratitude?

</b>           Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see
           how things work out.
           Radburn starts to take the old shirt.

</b>           No! It was from my wife.

</b>           Rags and tatters. Rags and
           tatters.
           Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls
           them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
           Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He
           pushes the plate away rather than eat.

           enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon

           calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls
           should feel like little more than background noise.

           doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is
           Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties;
           ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her
           fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin
           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's
           half sister.
           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly
           this is mother and child being reunited.

           Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with
           Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza
           drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon

<b>                          ELIZA
</b>           When I say I had my master's
           favor, you understand. Above even
           his own wife, I had it. Do you
           know that he built a house for me?
           Built it on the sole condition
           that I reside there with him. The
           added promise in time I would be
           emancipated. And for nine years
           he blessed me with every comfort
           and luxury in life.
           Displaying the finery she still wears:

</b>           Silks and jewels and even servants
           to wait upon us. Such was our
           life, and the life of this
           beautiful girl I bore for him.
           But Master Berry's daughter...she
           always looked at me with an unkind
           nature. She hated Emily no matter
           she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
           As Master Berry's health failed,
           she gained power in the household.
           Eventually, I was brought to the
           city on the false pretense of our
           free papers being executed. If I
           had known what waited; to be sent
           south? I swear I would not have
           come here alive.

           Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure

           Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
           Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if
           wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure
           of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and
           Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of

           Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the

           enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 
           vessel. 
           MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and 
           ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT

           The slaves are asleep. 
           A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends 
           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 
           face. 
           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 
           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 
           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 
           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 
           hold. 
           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 
           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand 
           to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you 
           don't." 
           Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. 
           There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor 
           and Robert, an impasse. 
           We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile 
           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of 
           incomprehension. 
           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 
           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. 
           The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. 
           A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the

           Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
           Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and
           DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
           like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
           laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
           Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
           He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,
           his master now represents "freedom."

           Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other

           desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray.
           But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue
           on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in
           Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they
           fade into the environs and are gone from sight.

           stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
           As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it
           opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
           For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
           These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
           in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
           gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -

<b>           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
</b>           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

           oppression in place.

           led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.
           The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with
           ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
           Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
           pen.
           Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
           downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to
           each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
           new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all
           that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.

           The slaves are in various states of undress, men and
           women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap
           and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is
           oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they
           primp themselves.

           It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
           fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
           PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
           tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
           less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
           livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
           good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
           slaves.
           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
           being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of
           five or so.

<b>                          FREEMAN

           Keep your heads up. A sense of
           direction; that's how you look
           smart. None of those saucer eyes.
           Rid yourself of that smile. Look

           Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Can you play a reel?

</b>           He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let
           him play, boy. Let's see what he
           can do.
           Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
           Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
           stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
           warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

           We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
           CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
           gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
           displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
           Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
           smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
           to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
           hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
           skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
           slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
           At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
           side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
           One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
           Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
           A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
           attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
           he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:

<b>                          FORD

           Platt and Eliza?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           A thousand for Platt; he is a
           nigger of talent. Seven hundred
           for Eliza. My fairest price.

<b>                          FORD

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
           Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
           separated from her family. She begs of Ford:

           and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-

           ripe fruit. He will grow into a
           fine beast.
           Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting
           his activity and his condition.

           He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,
           counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the
           already extended hand of Freeman.
           Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly
           touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.

<b>                          FORD

           continues to scream for her children as Emily does for
           her mother.

           As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to
           play lightly.

           Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is
           barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets
           the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.
           Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring
           to be strong-

<b>                          EMILY

           Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping
           both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room
           by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.

           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
           way of compassion.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           "But as touching the resurrection
           of the dead, have ye not read that
           which was spoken unto you by God,
           saying, I am the God of Abraham,
           and the God of Isaac, and the God
           of Jacob. God is not the God of
           the dead, but of the living. And
           when the multitude heard this,
           they were astonished at his
           doctrine. Then one of them, which
           was a lawyer, asked him a
           question, tempting him, and
           saying, Master, which is the
           great commandment in the law?
           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
           love the Lord thy God with all thy
           heart, and with all thy soul, and
           with all thy mind. This is the
           first and great commandment. And
           the second is like unto it, thou
           shalt love thy neighbor as
           thyself. On these two
           commandments hang all the law and
           the prophets."

           in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED

           They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of
           the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As
           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN
           FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;
           trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
           guttural, sing-song noise.
           The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon
           particularly taken by the music...if not entirely
           enthralled by it.

<b>          74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74
</b>
           Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
           river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO
           DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing
           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
           him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
           Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were
           a man possessed.

           Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as
           Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making
           rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.

           sail, even with a boat full of
           load. The distance from the WORK
           AREA to the point on the latter
           bayou is several miles by water
           fewer than land. It occurs to me

           TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES
           ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just
           a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic
           to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the
           slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And
           rightly they do.
           Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
           which he will transport the timber.
           Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP

           just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their
           manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
           Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber
           winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally
           applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just
           been shown up after all.

           As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
           with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously
           owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
           It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's
           gratitude is easily expressed.

           Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
           He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years"
           is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now
           finds himself.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           They is no such thing.
           Solomon runs his hands over the boards.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           As smooth to the touch as a
           yearling's coat.

</b>           Callin' me a liar, boy?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Only a matter of perspective, sir.
           From where you stand you may see
           differently. But the hands are
           not mistaken. I ask only that you
           employ all your senses before
           rendering judgement.
           What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do
           is spew invectives.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           You are a brute. You are a dog,
           and no better for followin'
           instruction.

           Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work.
           After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in
           the drive of the great house. It involves an
           inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart
           DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.
           Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days
           as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.

           It is day break. As ordered, Solomon is up and working.
           Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for
           Solomon.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           If Tibeats prefers a different
           size, I will endeavor to furnish
           them, but you may use those until
           further directed.

</b>
           As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking
           in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even
           before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
           belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.

<b>                          TIBEATS

</b>           Yes, master. I am about it. I
           have begun on the other side of
           the house.
           Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is
           picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Didn't I tell yah last night to
           get a keg of nails of Chapin?

</b>           And so I did; and Chapin said he
           would get another size for you, if
           you wanted them when he came back
           from the field.
           Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward
           Solomon "with a great passion:"

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
           somethin'!
           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
           no mood for Tibeats.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I did as instructed. If there's
           something wrong, then its wrong
           with your instructions.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
           black bastard!
           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
           to fetch a whip.
           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
           marches back whip in hand.

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Strip yer clothes!
           Solomon does no such thing.

</b>           Strip!

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I will not.
           With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for
           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and

</b>

</b>           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
           handle again and again and again.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Yew will not live ta see another
           day, nigger! This is yer last, I
           swear it!
           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
           then pleas for mercy:

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,
           help me. God be merciful!
           And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Papa I'm sorry!
           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
           ground.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           What is the matter?
           Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
           dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on

</b>           What's the matter with the nails?
           With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats
           says, as if being exposed-

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           They're...they're too large.

           Mr. Tibeats?
           Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the
           shaking of his fist.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           This ain't done by half. I will
           have flesh, and I will have all of
           it.
           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
           Anxiety mounts on his features.
           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
           fetch him.
           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
           an air of impending trouble.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           Do not stir. Do not attempt to
           leave the plantation on any
           account whatever. But if you run
           there is no protecting you.

</b>           If you run, Platt, there is no
           protecting you. Rachel...!
           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
           kitchen.
           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
           unexpected mounts.
           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
           and he knows that death awaits him.

<b>           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS

</b>           Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and
           watches, but does not move to Solomon.
           Solomon waits, and waits...
           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They
           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Tha's the one. Tha's him.
           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
           it intensely palpable.
           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
           he begins to struggle and fight.
           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
           life is choked from him.
           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
           "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with
           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
           need to be much more demonstrative.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
           nigger another foot from where he
           stands is a dead man. I am
           overseer of this plantation seven
           years, and in the absence of
           William Ford, my duty is to
           protect his interests. Ford holds
           a mortgage on Platt of four
           hundred dollars. If you hang him,
           he loses his debt. Until that is
           canceled you have no claim to his
           life.
           Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:

           regard for your own safety...I
           say, begone!
           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.

           yah strung up as well.
           Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment
           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

           to Master Ford. Tell him to come
           here at once without a single
           moment's delay. Tell him they are
           trying to murder Platt. Hurry,

           kill the mule to do so!

           Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much
           speed.

           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight
           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on
           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the
           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging
           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this
           time and space.

</b>           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his
           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate
           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as
           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
           property dispute, he offers no further aid.
           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the
           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in
           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he
           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes
           flutter between life and lifelessness...

           Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in
           sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips
           dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may
           very well expire before the day is over.
           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she
           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of
           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for
           him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
           water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,
           and leaves Solomon to hang.

           The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon
           remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford,
           trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,
           and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:

<b>                          FORD
</b>           Platt... My poor Platt.
           Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon
           attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to
           the ground and passes out.

           As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on
           the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He
           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to
           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has
           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It
           will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting
           place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage.

</b>           Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his
           surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and
           is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he
           started?
           From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He
           goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see
           nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
           He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I believe Tibeats is skulkin'
           about the premises somewhere. He
           wants you dead, and he will
           attempt to have you so. It's no
           longer safe for you here. And I
           don't believe you will remain
           passive if Tibeats attacks. I
           have transferred my debt to Edwin
           Epps. He will take charge of you.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           (desperate, urgent)
           Master Ford, you must know; I am
           not a slave.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I cannot hear that.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Before I came to you I was a
           freeman.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I am trying to save your life!
           And...I have a debt to be mindful
           of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
           He is a hard man. Prides himself
           on being a "nigger breaker." But
           truthfully I could find no others
           who would have you. You've made a
           reputation of yourself. Whatever
           your circumstances, you are an
           exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear
           no good will come of it.

</b>           Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them
           altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty
           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
           is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to
           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
           sexuality.
           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
           THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer
           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
           Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone
           of compassion with which Ford read.

<b>                          EPPS

           It is August, "cotton picking" season.
           We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It
           presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of
           light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to
           seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

           There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a
           sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the
           mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed
           at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of
           cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are
           again filled.

           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the

           Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and

           of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon
           strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and
           the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of

           As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on
           Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
           motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
           Patsey twirl about the floor.
           This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all
           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square

           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first
           time they've seen as much from the Mistress.

           For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey

           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped 
           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 
           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 
           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 
           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 
           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 
           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. 
           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is 
           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 
           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 
           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 
           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 
           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 
           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 
           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.

           The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around

           men; again there is a moment of connection. 
           Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and 
           spitting, behind his shoulder.

           they can get expressed with
           kindness or wit violence. A lusty
           visit in the night, or a
           visitation from the whip. And wit
           my experience, if'n I can give
           comfort, then comfort I give. And
           you take comfort, Patsey; the Good
           Lord will manage Epps. In His own
           time the Good Lord will manage dem
           all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
           comin' that will burn as an oven.
           It comin' as sure as the Lord is
           just. When His will be done...the
           curse on the Pharos is a poor
           example of all that wait 'fo the
           plantation class.
           Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
           slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
           of her tea.

           Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and
           moves toward the pair in a rage.

</b>           Patsey...!
           Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off
           as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of

</b>           No words were spoken. None of

           Epps grabs Solomon.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           I'll cut your black throat.
           Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
           PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around
           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
           even get close to the slave.
           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:

           I admit that it did, and I done

           us carryin' on like this. Help me
           ta my feet, and let us both pray
           to the Lord for forgiveness.
           Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
           drops down. And again offering a treaty:

</b>           I'm all done in, Platt. I have

           equal to 'em. I concede to yah,
           but in the name of valor, help yer
           master to his feet.
           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

           began when I was sent to retrieve
           Patsey from where she'd taken
           sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon
           returning, Master Epps believed
           Patsey and me to be in
           conversation when we were not. I
           tried to explain, but it lead to
           all this.

</b>

<b>           -AUGUST, 1844-
</b>           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
           none move to help him. None dare.
           From Treach rather matter of factly:

<b>                          TREACH
</b>           Get him water.
           Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,

<b>           DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY
</b>
<b>           ANYTHING TO DRINK.
</b>           Roused, Henry rights himself.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Go'won. Git up.
           Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
           cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
           song is all that can keep him going.

           Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear
           from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's
           come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As
           if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly
           cries.

</b>
           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -
           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
           him.
           Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

           Epps order. Among the items set before Solomon is
           another quantity of foolscap.

           Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
           He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
           store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he
           folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up
           the sack and continues on his way.

           Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his
           fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He
           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality
           it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first
           step toward freedom.

<b>           -DECEMBER, 1844-
</b>           It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in
           quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding
           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
           dance.
           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
           pastries. She sets them down on a table.

<b>                          MISTRESS EPPS
</b>           A moment from the dancing. Come
           sample what I baked for y'all.
           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,
           Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           There'll be none for you, Patsey.
           Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,
           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah see that? Did yah see the
           look of insolence she give me?

           black animals to leave us gut like
           pigs in our own sleep?
           Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.
           It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           You are manless. A damned eunuch

           at least be a credit to yer own
           kind and beat every foul thought
           from 'em.
           Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose.
           She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE

<b>           PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES.

<b>           FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN,

           collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.

           Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps
           takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His
           intentions are plain.
           All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however,
           displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And
           then we dance.
           The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.

</b>           Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field
           in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and
           under grown.
           The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but
           rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms
           have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
           We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among
           and destroying the cotton crop.

           up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move
           let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real

           his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of
           survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually
           ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him

<b>           -NOVEMBER, 1846-
</b>           ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are
           divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,
           the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the
           rows after.
           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves
           with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he
           displayed picking cotton.
           Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.

           As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -
           Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
           She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact
           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be
           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes
           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely
           stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

</b>           SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon
           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

<b>           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
</b>
<b>           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
</b>
<b>           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
</b>
<b>           SOLOMON.
</b>           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
           perfunctory than passionate.
           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous
           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
           as though the act had not happened at all.

           fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.
           Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed
           berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.
           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.
           Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some

           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.

</b>           Runaways I would expect. The
           Bayou full with 'em. They nothin'

<b>          130 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130
</b>

<b>           -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-
</b>           Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
           low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
           As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.

<b>           "IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
</b>           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond
           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
           her dress.
           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite

<b>                          PLAINLY:
</b>
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I am hungry. Give me food.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Who are you?

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I'm hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
           famished, devours it.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           What is your name?

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           My name is Celeste.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           What are your circumstances?

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave
           been two days among da palmettoes.
           Celeste is sick and cain't work,
           and would rather die in the swamp

</b>           than be whipped to death by the
           overseer. So I took myself away.
           Massa's dogs won't follow me. The
           patrollers 'ave tried to set dem
           on me. But dey a secret between
           dem and Celeste, and dey won't
           mind the devilish orders of the
           overseer.
           Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you believe me?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Yes.

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Why?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           There are some whose tracks the
           hounds will refuse to follow.

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Give me more food. I'm starvin'.

</b>
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Give it to me.
           Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
           eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           Most slaves escape at night. The
           overseers are alert for such
           chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
           'n alight in the middle of the day
           wit the sun up at its highest.
           The place of my concealment now
           deep in the swamp, not half a mile
           from Massa's plantation, and a
           world apart. A world a tall
           trees whose long arms make fo' a
           canopy so dense dey keep away even
           the beams of the sun. It twilight
           always in Celeste's world, even in
           the brightest day. I will live
           there, and I will live freely.
           The overseers are a cowardly lot.
           Dey will not go where their dogs
           show fear and where it always be
           night. Others will join me in the
           twilight, and we ain't gunna be
           slaves no 'mo forever.

           vision.

           Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
           Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
           about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
           it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
           will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.

<b>           EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT
</b>
           Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious
           nature as he waits.
           Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is
           Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way
           directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says:

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I am hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She
           opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats:

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           I was rude, and didn't even ask yo

           your nature.

           A nigger that can read and write

           There is a pause. Solomon can't answer this question. It
           is the glaring hole in his plan.
           Having finished eating:

           around disoriented, calling into the blackness:

</b>           Celeste...
           Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds
           and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving
           closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more
           frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite
           literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then
           neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to
           guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to
           crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

           calls to her - desperately - for assistance.

<b>                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)
</b>           Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!
           In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
           done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this
           is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.
           It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or
           maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
           himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
           in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
           never to be seen again.

</b>

<b>           -MAY/JUNE, 1847-
</b>           We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
           stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
           as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
           wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
           gathered.
           The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
           returned.

</b>           A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark

           Indicating to the cotton:

</b>           As thick 'n white as New England
           snow. 'N now my niggers is
           returned to me.

           Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,
           with your slick nigger ways?
           Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.
           Not on my land. Much work to do.
           Days of old long since, eh?
           Joyous! Joyous indeed!
           Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
           who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
           HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
           display many new scars. It's clear that in the
           intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
           boy for Epps and the Mistress.

</b>           The slaves are out working on the field. White hands
           appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at
           picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.
           As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short
           on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd
           be called a "slacker." He joins in with the slaves,
           singing a spiritual.

           Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps
           has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already

           We come in after the punishment has been dealt. Patsey

</b>           It's a tragedy. How does such
           come to pass? Working a field and
           picking cotton like a lowly hand.
           I'm of a damn sight better
           station. And my desires never
           lacked for a grandiose component,
           though I will admit they have at
           times been short on ingenuity.
           But only at times. I've worked as

</b>           Not "sir." Just Armsby. Not owed
           more than any other in the field.
           I worked plantations from
           Virginia, down into Alabama. I
           could manage easy a hundred slaves
           and have done so. But to toil in
           the field? Never thought that
           would come to pass. Never. But

           the whisky, a little too
           undependable on the job. Before
           you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,
           let me state my case: As reliable
           employment as overseeing is, it's
           no easy chore on the spirit. I
           say no man of conscious can take
           the lash to another human day in,
           and day out without shredding at
           his own self. Takes him to a
           place where he either makes
           excuses within his mind to be
           unaffected... Or finds some way
           to trample his guilty sensations.
           Well, I trampled.

           riches. But such profitable
           outcomes are reserved for the

           of the rest of us to serve. So I

           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a
           spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle
           Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the
           ground.
           Treach calls to Edward:

           Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when

           "where John baptized three."
           The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now
           filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have
           created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to
           transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy
           which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has
           been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's
           captivating, infectious.
           This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the
           audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the
           seemingly chastising environment.
           The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist,
           some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,
           because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And
           with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.

           ask only that you deposit a letter
           in the Marksville post office.
           And that you keep the action an
           inviolable secret forever. The
           details of the letter are of no
           consequence. Even at that, there
           would be an imposition of much
           pain and suffering were it known I
           was the author. A patron is what
           I require, sir.

           Armsby considers the request.

           whatever payment is offered.
           Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he
           can wholly give himself over to trust.

           Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
           conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
           works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
           normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
           matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
           But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
           talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
           Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
           for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
           Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.

           The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,
           without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment
           there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for
           Patsey...?
           Looking right to Solomon:

</b>           Get up.
           Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He
           says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.

           Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
           shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
           Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
           his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
           a FLASK.
           Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
           friend, and guides him into the woods.

           A beat.

           believe we're all going to run
           away and then he thinks you'll
           hire an overseer to watch us. He
           believes you are soft soap. He's
           given to such talk. I believe
           he's just made this story out of
           whole cloth, 'cause he wants to
           get a situation. It's all a lie,

           all a lie.
           For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go.
           Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and
           equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's
           thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill
           intentions.

           And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever
           being free. He stands and looks at it as if forever, as

           MR. SAMUEL BASS, a between forty and fifty years old, of
           light complexion and light hair. He is cool and self-
           possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with

           As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation
           going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the
           art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled
           mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does
           little more than joke his way around the facts.
           Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps
           offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.

           washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their
           clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry
           near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It

           The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to

           drops into true sorrow.

           Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks
           up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps
           steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief.
           As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from
           where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is

           Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She
           gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction.
           Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his
           whip.

           Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no
           matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the
           blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating
           and spurring him on.

<b>                          MISTRESS EPPS

           Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand
           ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to
           deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting
           the whip at him:

           begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms
           before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too
           distraught to watch.
           But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon's
           half-hearted effort.

<b>                          MISTRESS EPPS
</b>           He pantomimes. There ain't barely
           a welt on her. That's what your
           niggers make of yah; a fool fer
           the takin'.
           Epps's grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL
           FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves.

<b>                          EPPS

           strike her until her flesh is rent
           and meat and blood flow equal, or
           I will kill every nigger in my
           sight!
           Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.
           But from the ground, from Patsey:

<b>                          PATSEY
</b>           Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I
           am dead.
           What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly
           whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey
           screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...
           After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is
           not satisfied.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           Until I say no more! I ain't said
           nothing!
           Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as
           promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE

<b>           THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.
</b>           Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do
           no more.

<b>                          EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Strike her! Strike her!
           Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips
           Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The
           painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
           Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
           The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
           dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases
           struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

           away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying.
           Solomon, screaming at Epps:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Thou devil! Sooner or later,
           somewhere in the course of eternal
           justice thou shalt answer for this
           sin!
           Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying
           anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           No sin! There is no sin! A man

           goddamn careful I don't come to
           wantin' to lightenin' my mood no
           further.
           By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in
           the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the
           foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign
           everywhere.
           Everywhere else.
           Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the
           Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back
           into the house.
           Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the
           cabin.

           long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe
           applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to
           assist and console her.
           In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon.
           She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and
           then her eyes close again.

           Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually

</b>           Montreal and Kingston and
           Queenston and a great many places.
           And I have been in York state,
           too. Buffalo and Rochester and
           Albany, and can tell you the names
           of the villages on the Erie canal
           and the Champlain canal.

           Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps
           has told in the intervening.

<b>                          BASS

           in no good way.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           That slavery is an evil that
           should befall none?

           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
           floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

           Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon
           immediately hands over.

</b>           But that was a long, long time
           ago. I've been traveling this
           country for the best part of
           twenty years. My freedom is
           everything. The fact that I can
           walk out of here tomorrow gives me
           most pleasure. I see the aching in
           your eyes, the pain of not being
           attached to your loved ones. My
           life doesn't mean much to anyone,
           but it seems your life means a lot
           to a lot of people. What you have
           just said to me scares me, and I
           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
           just for you, but for me.
           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
           Solomon, slightly confused.

           It will be a duty. Now, would you
           be so kind as to pass me those
           nails, sir.
           We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
           unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the
           conversation had never occurred.

           more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly
           slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His
           eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.

</b>
<b>                          SLOW DISSOLVE
</b>           To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
           Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
           approaches, Bass shouts-

<b>                          BASS
</b>           And bring those markers!
           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and
           approaches Bass.

</b>           No letter yet.

<b>                          SOLOMON

           Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the
           earth.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I have inquired thoroughly. More
           than is safe for either of us.
           Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground,
           improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.

           Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation
           should be very clear.

           their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold
           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
           something that is a million miles away.
           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
           He then repeats the action.
           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
           ground.
           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
           an odd way, respectful.

           their way in the trying soil. Solomon, too focused to
           note the arrival of two men by carriage: Parker and the

</b>           While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker

           By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
           their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
           in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
           out of sight of Epps.
           Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
           next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
           emotion.
           Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
           his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
           that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
           to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to

           Epps walks back into the plantation.
           The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back
           by the call of Patsey's voice:

           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
           Solomon and they embrace.
           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
           rides off furiously.

           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They

           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
           state, the other slaves around her.
           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
           forever more.

<b>           EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY
</b>

<b>           -MARCH, 1853-
</b>           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Are you ready?
           Solomon swallows and nods.

</b>
           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the
           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than
           familiar strangers.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I apologize for my appearance. I
           have had a difficult time of
           things these past many years.
           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as
           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his

           Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost
           breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the

           Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           And this is your grandson.
           Solomon Northup Staunton.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...Solomon...
           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
           Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
           ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
           says to Anne with all his heart:

<b>                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)
</b>           Forgive me.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           There is nothing to forgive.
           The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
           other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
           their lives.

</b>           Upon gaining his freedom, Solomon Northup located and
           attempted to seek legal justice against the men who
           kidnapped him. The case was tried in Washington, DC
           where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying

</b>           against whites. The charges against the kidnappers were
           eventually dismissed.
           Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
           abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
           Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
           The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
           remain unknown.
